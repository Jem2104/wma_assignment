We placed our orders: 2 shrimp poboys, 1 catfish poboy with onion ring sides, 1 order of the pimento sausage fries, and barbecue shrimp.

The food came out with the wrong sides. If you've every had a shrimp poboy any where I'm sure it didnt come out with 6 pieces of shrimp with a cost of $16.5. The kicker to all of this is despite the poor service and delay in food I tipped 18% because I tip regardless. When I checked my account, the restaurant charged me a different amount and increased the tip amount!The issue isn't the amount because its negligible and would cost me more time to go through and get it fixed but its the principle of knowing you cant trust the merchant you give your card.Never again Second Line, fraud, poor service, and lackluster food.",1,144,9,10,0

After this second visit I can undoubtedly say that y'all are my favorite restaurant in Memphis and I'm super grateful to all the chefs who cook such amazing local food and that the costs are kept reasonable as well! And the service is so wonderful too! I took x 3 work colleagues here and everyone was super pleased - even picky eaters and one Co-worker who is gluten intolerant was amazed that he could eat _every_ single thing on the menu! So for a breakdown, we split 1 starter and x2 mains among four hungry adults:1) Crisp Brussels - apples, cranberry, almonds, onion chips, bacon and amazing walnut aioli. AMAZING! I heart the way these guys cook Brussels Sprouts and that crisp sage leaf was amazing. We licked the plate clean. Great start to our meal.2) Sea scallops- turnip purée, citrus butter, smoked bacon, lobster roe and truffled paprika oil. SUPERB!! Scallop seared to perfection and was so juicy! Also that turnip purée - I've got to figure out to replicate that at home!3) Half Chicken under a brick - smoked cream corn, Swiss chard, curry leaf cashew chutney. BRILLIANT! Tender moist falling off the bone chicken and that curry leaf cashew chutney was bliss! My co-diners licked the smoked cream corn clean from the serving plate.I loved how our selections just flowed from one to the next menu item and there wasn't a wrong note in any bite. I'd be hard pressed to pick my favorite dish of the night, it really is that hard! But because we were circumspect with our meal selections there was a comfortable space left on our bellies for dessert. We ended up sharing a trio of delicious desserts! We got Passion fruit sorbet x2 scoops (each scoop is only $2.50 and this was a terrific palate cleanser between the other desserts), the fantastic Chocolate nirvana (Nutella cream y'all!) and then the Vanilla cheesecake which had awesome strawberry coulis and was light and delightful with each bite.

I'm in love - my fave of the night. It was raw, which I wasn't expecting. I tried it by itself and then with the poached eggs and it was glorious eating both ways Watermelon salad: the jalapeño pieces were a great spicy touch against the sweet watermelon and salty goat cheese. Good harmonious flavors.Fried Oysters: my 2nd fave dish of the night. Those oysters were juicy and also very nice breading that they'd been fried in. Liked the spicy sauce that accompanied the oysters as well. Mains:Braised Pork Loin: hands down the favorite of the table for the night. Very tender, great spicy pepper rub and accompanying lentils was a superb pairing. Unfortunately, the broccolini was burnt...Duo of Duck: the side of sweet potato was the star of this dish. The leg was too salty and the loin was a touch undercooked. Snapper: fish was elegantly cooked but seasoning was not to everyone's taste. The mashed potatoes that accompanied this dish also got differing opinions- 1 person found it too fluffy! The buckchoy  was delish.Dessert:-Chocolate Nirvana: flourless choco cake, Nutella cream, chocolate mousse, Chantilly and toasted hazelnuts - we all LOVED this! Would get again.- Vanilla cheesecake: Wild strawberry couli, fresh berries and sorbetto. The couli was awesome but the cheesecake was meh for me.Overall, we had a great time - food was delightful, service was lovely and I can't wait to come back.Note: #349 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016",0,2,15,0,0

Graphic lighting and interior. Went for lunch on a rainy October afternoon. Curfew is part of a restaurant group headed by Favio Viviani from top chef fame in 2005.After checking the menu and taking my server, Virginia's recommendation I had de Spanish octopus for an appetizer. Man oh man! That is some good, tender, semi-spicy octopus nation point I don't think that I've ever had better in my whole life. Often times octopus is somewhat of a struggle to eat because the kitchen will cook it inproperly. When prepared incorrectly, it can be as tough as an old boot. With octopus you either cook it briefly or cook it a long time and anything in the middle is wrong. These chefs know their stuff. I'll have this one again and again! Great job Virginia!!Having had such a great experience on the first course as recommended by Virginia, I have decided to try one of their small pizzas, all of which are advertised as ""Roman style"". The one I tried was ""Carne di Curfew - house-made tasso, boar sausage, bacon, roasted onion, mozzarella & parmesan"". Virginia described it topped with house-made Tasso and sausage on a crust made with double zero flour. I think I am impressed her for the first time by knowing what double zero flour is. It is Italian, low-protein, soft white flour.  The Italians famously use it not only for pizza crust but also for other flatbreads and Focaccia.I had a Apple Harvest cocktail from there list. ""Virginia says""  Bourbon, Amaro Melleti, Apple Juice, Lemon Juice, Fresno Chili Pepper Syrup. Works really well to remind me of fall. Nicely sweet/tart with a tiny spicy backfire from the Fresno chili simple syrup. So good I had two!!I'll return here frequently and you should too!

I was as wrong as a highway wrong turn sign! 90% of my steak could not be eaten as pictures show below. My steak was burnt and tasted like coal and full of fat so I could not eat it all. My jaws hurt from chewing so long on the few and, im not exaggerating, few pieces I could chew. The boiled potatoes were not all done. The A1 steak sauce did no justice for the improperly cooked steak.   The octopus   was just as horrible. As seen in the internet pics below it was suppose to be a sight for soar eyes and a new experience. The octopus was burnt, the celery slaw was soaked in oil, the lemon was even burnt!

To the ever growing & expanding Broad ave district. Liquor Store offers. An array of menu items serving All Day Breakfast,Sandwiches, & my personal favorites. Cuban Platters & Street Tacos. Unfortunately I didn't get to order any of those 2 in the plates section of the menu that morning. There were no regrets. I ordered the Classic Breakfast Plate that makes my VIP list of Best Memphis Breakfasts. Their hash browns. have the most awesome combination of juicy,crisp, & spiced to perfection. The Biscuits I will have to say are generously moist. With a perfect consistency that wasn't too fluffy & had the perfect amount of firmness. Which is ideal for the perfect Biscuits & Gravy. I was highly content with my eggs & bacon as the eggs are scrambled to the right amount of its soft consistency. Bacon on the other was juicy crispy spiced to perfection and succulent.    Outside of the food I was absolutely impressed.  Their simple building exterior of the well aged neon signage is very appealing,left in its natural state. Their interior is also stunning, decadent & beautiful. with their decor done in a tropical theme. With bright vibrant colors that will give you a feel of being in a 1950's style diner overlooking a beach in Cuba. I was also impressed with,My server Bailey. who was very friendly & diligent. In making sure our overall experience at The Liquor Store was very delightful.

There was a few people in front of us but we were seated fairly quickly. Definitely get there before 11 if you don't want to wait. It is a small establishment so be mindful of that. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with a fried egg over easy, cheddar cheese, and the Cuban pork with a side of hash browns. The fried egg was cooked perfectly and I was able to use it as sauce for my sandwich and my hash browns. My hash browns were perfectly crispy on the outside without being burnt but there was still some soft potato shreds in the hash brown patty. The Cuban pork was nice and soft. It was seasoned well and had a hint of lime zing. I only wish the biscuit was fluffy. It was like they had made all the biscuits in the morning and so the biscuit had been sitting out and got a little hard.My cousin ordered the shiitake mushroom gravy over 2 large biscuits, scrambled eggs and extra crispy bacon. I actually had the mushroom gravy dish the first time I was there and it was still just as good. It's nice and peppery and just soaks into the biscuit so it's a nice spoonful of yummy. I think that sauce should have been on my breakfast sandwich. She also orders a Wiseacre cold brew with a side of almond milk. She was disappointed with it. I tried it and it had some sort of fizz to it which I did not like at all since it's a coffee and not a beer.Lastly I ordered the beignets which are made from their biscuit dough so they are a bit dense. However the dolce de leche sauce that comes with is finger licking good.The service was quick, friendly and attentive. I only had drunk maybe an inch of my water and it was refilled.I tried to see if there was a discount for teachers but they only did military discounts.Overall, It is a small but quaint restaurant  with a varying array of dishes and quick and friendly service.

Yelp guided us there and I think it was a solid choice. The Liquor Store actually used to be a liquor store and I think the owners have done a great job with making it a diner. The diner is located on Broad Street in Memphis. Apparently this area has been going through a resurgence and it shows with all he cute little shops and restaurants. The Liquor Store fits right in.The decor was quaint and there was so much light - I love bright places for breakfast over dark and dank. It was also decorated for the holidays making the establishment quite festive. The crowd was festive too.There was a small wait when we arrived. There isn't a lot of room to wait. Luckily some spots opened up at the bar, which is first come first serve. The staff is friendly and quick. Since the place is so small you can see everyone working.I did think their breakfast menu was a bit limited and not as creative as I would have thought it would be for an area that seemed to be catering a bit to the hipster crowd. I thought it might be a bit more farm to table. I ended up ordering the Brussel sprouts and ordered poached eggs to put on top. The dish was well done and had a ton of flavor.My husband wasn't as impressed. He felt that the biscuits were a bit dry and underwhelming. Overall I really thought the staff was friendly and efficient. We had been on the road since 5am, and it was nice to feel welcome even thought we were out of towners. We chatted with some friendly customers while waiting, and our server was funny and top notch. The food came out quickly and I good see it being made - it's a small place and I was impressed at the efficiency of the cook staff - they don't have much space to work with. I wasn't sure they would even make poached eggs, and they did a fantastic job.If we are ever back in the Memphis area I'd like to be able to visit again and have a bloody Mary.",5,42,191,1200,1

And the time has come! The bubble domes caught my eye and are perfect for being covid safe right now..along with of course instagram worthy! They only have 2 bubbles on their patio so make sure you reserve them if you definitely want to sit in one. Its great for a small friend group to hangout and have brunch together. Otherwise the inside of the restaurant is super cute too. Next time I visit I want to sit in one of the hairstyling booths! So cute!!Outside there are 2 bubbles, and a couple bench tables. All within good distances apart. Before you arrive they take your temperatures and the staff were all wearing masks and seemed to be very safe the whole visit. I went pretty close to when they open on a Saturday morning, which wasn't to busy. They had a bunch menu, as they do on Sunday mornings.  The waitress said the Chilequiles were a popular item and was really tasty so I went with her suggestion. For my drink I had a mimosa. You have the choice of OJ, or grapefruit. I was feeling crazy so I got the grapefruit. It didn't disappoint, it was a delicious and refreshing choice. My meal came out in a pretty timely manner, I do think they like to keep everyone moving and not lingering and sitting too long. Again being covid friendly and doing their best!  The chips were a good mixture of crunchy and soft, the guac was pretty tasty and chunky ( if that's your fav), but I didn't taste a whipped egg. But then again, I don't think I've had one so Im not quite sure what taste I was searching for! Ha. Overall it was pretty good. I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't disappointed. If I do order this again I think I would add chicken or shrimp to give some more flavor. Their menu has lots of yummy sounding options on their Brunch and Dinner menu to check out.

I ordered the Chilequiles. The best way I know to describe it is a nacho omelet - so pretty tasty as you can imagine. I've never had anything like this before, so points for that. The truffle fries were also great - fresh cut and well-seasoned. I really liked the food, but I wasn't a fan of the prices. It was an upcharge to add protein to the Chilequiles (so I didn't add), and the dish was already on the expensive side in my opinion. Additionally, 18% gratuity was automatically added to the check - for a party of two people. I've never seen that before. 18% is already above the standard 15%. At another place, I have seen a ""service fee"" of 15% on the ticket for curbside pickup.  I understand why a restaurant might implement a service fee, especially in light of Covid.  However, gratuity, by definition, is optional. And unless the party has 6 or 8+ members, gratuity shouldn't be automatically charged without an explanation.UPDATE - I learned from the manager through Yelp that there was a note about the automatic gratuity on the menu (which I obviously missed) - it is Covid related to help ensure the staff are taken care of.  This takes care of my previous concerns.  I definitely appreciated the manager addressing my concerns on Yelp.  It shows a high commitment to customer service - that it goes beyond the walls of the restaurant.",13,172,221,1217,0

The chilaquiles is one of my favorites, and I appreciate the kind words about the food. We try to source our ingredients locally when possible and our pricing is on par with our competitors in the city.In light of covid, once our PPP loans expired and we could no longer match our employees' pay, we implemented an 18% gratuity on our weekend brunch shifts. On our menus, it states ""To help our staff who have been struggling from the effects of this pandemic, an 18% gratuity will be added to all checks. Thank you for your understanding during this time."" We don't try to hide this and I apologize you felt blindsighted. It was definitely not our intention!There are several other restaurants in town that have implemented service charges to ensure their staff is adequately taken care of through the pandemic. Since indoor capacity has now been cut to 25%, even one table not leaving a tip can drastically affect our staff's take-home pay for the day. We also are not allowed to seat parties larger than 4 at this time so the 20% gratuity on parties of six or more we previously had was no longer applicable. We hope you were provided service worthy of the 18%, which in our opinion is still within the appropriate range of tipping (before COVID, our staff averaged a 20% tip on most dining experiences). If your service was less than what you expected, please reach out and we would be happy to address any issues that may have arisen! Our staff is our priority and we go out of our way to ensure they are taken care of.",0,9,24,15,0

I assume they're using it for tracing in case someone were to contract COVID. A plus for me!! The green house was nice and cozy and had a little heater in there to keep us comfortable.

It is ALWAYS a go-to whenever I have people come in town to visit. Each visit, I will get their Chilaquiles and there is never anything left on my plate when I am done. I don't get meat in them, but it is an option to do so. They've got incredible shrimp and grits as well. My table will always split an order of beignets for the appetizer, and if you love powdered sugar, you will be very pleased with these, as they are COVERED and come with some kind of jam to dip them in. I also don't typically like mimosas, but the ones here are great, even for such a simple brunch drink. I've seen many people order the blueberry pancakes (only offered on Sundays for some reason). They love them every time! Obviously the environment is unbeatable. Be prepared to look cute and take lots of girly pictures! This is an old-fashion beauty shop turned into a modern-day restaurant, but so much of the original charm has been left over, creating a fun and hip and even groovy atmosphere. The service has never been bad. The servers are just as hip as the restaurant itself and I have never had a problem with a long wait time after being seated. Make reservations though! No matter when you plan on going. So all of that to say, this place is a three-in-one package: great food, great environment, great service. My three favorite things when going out to eat :).

Today I'm an featuring another great locally owned Memphis restaurant called Salt Water Crab in the heart of midtown. This cute sushi & seafood spot had more then you could ask for with a lunch menu and a dinner menu. They also have a cute outside patio with ample amount of seating with a pretty cool inside dining part. On to the food... my best friend and I went during lunch and for an appetizer we decided to go with the seafood dip. It was really good and full of flavor and a great starter.For the main course she decided to get the Godzilla Sushi Roll and I got the Atlantic Salmon w Scallop & Lump crab. Everything was deliciously made and really fresh! The salmon was really moist and had a great taste when it came down to the white wine sauce. Overall this is a nice restaurant for a nice date night or even a quick lunch break. Either one you will get your life right with every bite! Thank you @memphistravel and @ilovememphisblog for letting me partner with y'all again! Looking forward to more great memphis eating Have you been to Salt Water Crab?,6,51,120,554,1

I am a Memphian but I live in Georgia now, however I had heard about the controversy surrounding the owners here. I talked with a few folks and they assured me that they had never had a problem at this particular restaurant. In fact, one person in my party had recently eaten there a few weeks before for his birthday. So I decided to take a chance. I was able to make a reservation online and they called me personally to confirm and also called again to make sure I was still ok with sitting on the ""porch"" where they didn't have heaters. I thought this was a great way to kick off the visit. They do offer complimentary valet parking which is great because parking is limited in the area besides the garage. Before entering, you get your temperature taken and you have to give your contact information for contact tracing purposes. Big Bonus points for this. Plus EVERYONE is required to wear a mask. No exceptions. Quadruple points. I was seated promptly with my party of 3. We were overwhelmed by the top notch customer service we received. From the hostess, to the person who seated us, to the new manager (I can't recall his name but he's originally from California!), to the star of the show Courtney, everyone made this a truly pleasant experience! Courtney was an amazing server and I can't say that I've ever had a better one in all my years of dining out. She took amazingly good care of us and even brought out a complimentary birthday dessert (Crème Brulee) for me! And the manager ended up bringing a space heater to sit on the porch near our table to knock the chill off. Before the end of the night, we were ranting and raving about how exceptional the dining experience was here. Oh yeah, the food! For appetizer, I took Courtney's suggestion and got the crab cake. Pretty pricey for 1 crab cake BUT she was truthful, way more meat than filling. It was delicious. For my entrée, I had the salmon which was cooked to perfection, with whipped potatoes and sauteed spinach. It was a really good dish that didn't make me feel overly stuffed but I was full. I enjoyed the Memphian cocktail which was vodka based. After that I had a few lemon drop martinis. Now, if you come here, be prepared to drop some serious cash. The drinks are around $12-$14 each, appetizers are around $20, and the entrees are around $30-$35 at the lowest. However, it was my birthday and I wanted what I paid for, an exceptional dining experience with the best service. I will return here again on my next trip home. Thanks P & P!",5,247,508,1679,1

Brit had the roasted chicken entree, Candace had the gulf shrimp and I had the salmon. We also ordered fried green tomatoes, asparagus, and maple roasted sweet potatoes to share. The fried green tomatoes weren't the best we've had, but they were okay. Everything else was SO good. The salmon had a nice crisp on it and the glazed carrots were pretty tasty. Those maple roasted sweet potatoes, my goodness. I almost ordered another just for myself. They, along with the Brussels sprouts and bacon, were my faves for the night.

For dessert, I got the creme brûlée, Brit got the molten chocolate cake and Candace got the bread pudding. Once again, everyone seemed satisfied and said that it all tasted great.

The grilled tomato and onion was a nice little touch, but would it kill to get the whole tomato? Why just half lol.The tater tot poutine was way too salty.

This place is not jacket required but it is not McDonald's.  The pace is very casual and we did not feel rushed at all.  Definitely a vibe that I can get with. Some places make you feel rushed to order, eat and leave.  Not here.  The staff is super friendly and will answer questions on the menu and offer suggestions that are helpful (how we picked tiramisu for dessert). Let me get into the food.  We started with the bacon appetizer. Partly because we figure bacon will never lead you astray and it also received rave review from Facebook and Yelp so why not.  I have to say it was good but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's $24 good.  Having had it, I'll say this, get it once but if you plan on being a repeat customer I'm not sure it would be worth it again.   Now the main course. We both got steak.  I had the petite filet medium rare and the wife got ribeye the same.  Both of us had zero complaints. It was a true medium rare (which lets face it is hard to come by nowadays).  The sides are family style.  We got the mashed potatoes with truffles and cheese along with broccoli au gratin.   Let me very clear, the mashed potatoes are probably the best thing I have ever had  involving a potato.  The broccoli was ok.  But it is essentially broccoli and cheese and the broccoli pieces are tremendous in size.  Almost too large to eat honestly.  Desert we had tiramisu based on the recommendation of the server. And she did not fail. The in house pastry chef nailed it. And the portion size lends itself to sharing if you are with others.  One thing to bare in mind is they have limited beverages.  Water or alcohol is it.  It's not a deal breaker for me but you need to know that prior so you expect it.  Stellar service, atmosphere and food make Porch and Parlor make my list for places I recommend going.",6,3,36,91,1

I asked the shucker where the oysters came from and he said Apalatch and thats the spot for some of the best oysters in the country. Came back in late October, the heart of oyster season, and I was not disappointed. The gulf oyster were clean and beautiful with delicious flavor aided by the ginger mignonette sauce that was really off the charts good. The oysters here are probably some of the best in the city.

I have known I'm going on date night to see Anastasia for some time. We have season tickets to the Orpheum Broadway series. But I did not make reservations for dinner. Our first picks were booked for early dinner because I procrastinated. Those restaurants do not understand that I am big deal on Yelp. So to teach them a lesson if you guys would not make reservations on nights the Orpheum has a show on Saturday night it will help me out. We really should teach them a lesson. Anyway we got a 6:15pm reservation at Sweetgrass. Been wanting to check it out anyway. It's smaller in the dinning area than I thought. I didn't mind it. It just didn't really feel like a reservation type restaurant to me. The wait staff was good. Answered questions and did not crowd us. We ordered a cheese plate and the lamb chops. Both were good. Portion size was small but that was actually good for us. We hate to leave stuffed. Prices were reasonable so overall we enjoyed our dinner and would go back. Not sure it is a date night spot as much as it would be a place to hang out with a group of friends.,2,0,15,7,0

Very nice guy, he had the AYCE wings special that I knew nothing about for my lack of coolness to be informed when arriving.   Finally, after draining my entire beer one of them gets near enough to hear me call for him.  I order my food and he goes and puts it in the register but misses one thing...  My BEER is EMPTY!  So, I sit while waiting on my food to arrive with no beers...  BOO!  There seemed to be some sort of old reunion or something on the opposite end of the bar because that is where both bartenders stayed.  Ryan came out of the kitchen and joined in the festivities at the ""cool side of the bar"" never looking out or up at anyone else.  There I sit...  thirsty, at a bar...Food arrives; I ask for another beer and begin to eat.  At this point I am just ready to eat and leave.  The S&G were very good.  The ""chef dude"" next to me complimented the S&G and told me at S Grass you get scallops as well in the dish.  It was different than what I have had in the past but tasted delicious.  The chicken stock was a nice touch to the dish.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sausage was awesome.  I thought there could be more grits because it got really soupy at the end to eat with the supplied fork but hey, who am I?I will be back with a much cooler person than just me...  Maybe then I can get some attention????",0,0,69,9,0

I was beyond happy to see an Italian restaurant pop up in the Midtown area. They have made the space beautiful almost charming. It really feels like a lot of people sitting down to eat comforting food together. Some people will find the closeness of some of the tables uncomfortable, but for me it really added to the experience. Our waitress was exceptional and very thoughtful with her responses to our questions. She truly listened to what we asked her and gave a response that she felt catered to what we wanted. (Kudos to her!) But now, the food....They start you with this unassuming basket of bread with a little container of butter that is a form of creamy somewhere between liquid and solid. I've no idea how they do it. I had one moment from a scent before I ate it to realize how amazing it would be. I believe it is some type of garlic focaccia. Either way, it is scrumptious. It's not overly garlicky,  but it's assertive in a loving way that makes me wish for it as I type about it. We then move on to the feta stuffed sweet peppers. Originally, I was not planing on ordering the peppers, but the waitress answered my question when I ordered my rigatoni that sometimes it feels people up and sometimes they need a little extra. This would be my 'little extra'. When she placed them on the table, I was unsure how to feel. They certainly weren't large, but they are listed as a small plate. Also, I could not see little cubes or crumbles of feta, but rather a white sauce in the peppers. Regardless, they were delicious. I still don't know how they made white sauce out of feta, but it was wonderful. Hands down one my favorite fresh yet tasty things to get at a restaurant.  Then, rather quicker that imagined, but not in a bad way at all, the entrees arrived. My friend was quite please with her pizza. She got the steak and Gorgonzola and enjoyed with the one comment that they could put some of the flavors of the foccaia into the pizza dough.  For me, rigatoni with tomato and bacon gravy was too amazing of an idea to pass up, even for my go to of chick parm. It was quite honestly nothing like I imagined, yet everything I needed. I'm telling you, the people are miracle workers with sauces. The rigatoni pasta was clearly homemade and tasty. The dish was flavorful and meaty in a way that I didn't know bacon could be. It was beautiful, almost like eating a warm stew that comforts you from the inside and tells you the earth really is amazing.  I absolutely recommend it.  (Also, housemade ricotta...yes, please and thank you.)For the finale, we did do dessert. We got the ricotta donuts with cappuccino cream. Again, the cream told the story of every other sauce. It was pure perfection. Neither of us was a complete fan of the donut. The flavor was good, but it was quite dense. I almost wish they would keep the cream and stuff it in a profiterole or even better make a play on tiramisu with it. Welcome to Midtown Tamboli's!

The environment is nice enough for a date night, but was a chill enough environment to stop with a buddy for quick dinner. The staff were all extremely polite and very knowledgeable about the menu and offerings (This was OPENING NIGHT!). I had the chicken parmesan, my business partner had a wood fire cooked cheese pizza, and I was thoroughly impressed! Our order was out in minutes! The food tasted exactly like advertised and was clearly the freshest possible meats and veggies as each items had the FULL flavor! I left satisfied but in no way did I feel guilty...after eating I felt energized and light (sign of fresh REAL food). To top it all off, the owner came by and spoke with us about the local farms the source food from and their ever changing and evolving menu based on what their local farm partners produce!!! I will be making this a regular stop of mine! Great way to enter the Memphis food market!",0,1,38,1,0

Really hoping things improve over time as we'd love to have a thriving, local restaurant in the neighborhood. First visit: I left with the other three people in my party after waiting for an hour-and-a-half to still not be offered a table. We were told it was a 45 minute wait. We checked in a couple times with the hostess, who told us, ""soon,"" and then that we were fifth on the list. During this time there were a number of groups that walked in and were immediately sat. When we finally left the hostess apologized and said that while they do not technically take reservations, members of the ""founder's club"" in fact can make reservations and/or essentially skip the line. The party of 2 ahead of us had also also been waiting nearly 90 minutes. They were in town from Philadelphia to run the St. Jude marathon, and I hate that this was their impression of Memphis food and service. Maybe their meal made up for it.I understand that the restaurant allows people to call ahead, but the Tamboli's phone line was busy for the full hour leading up to our arrival. The restaurant needs to decide if it is truly ""no reservations,"" which would mean you have to show up to get a table. The nebulous ""calling ahead"" and even worse, the founder's club, just engender bad vibes for those waiting and appears as poor customer service on the part of the hosting staff. If someone's wait is going to be double what you originally said, you should give them a heads up.The second time we tried the restaurant it was just two of us, and we were told there was a table available in the bar area. The food was fine: my husband wasn't blown away by the pasta special but technically there was nothing wrong with it. My veggie plate was pretty good, if not a little cold. The table service was just bad and our server basically could not be bothered with us. We waited a while to even get menus, waited even longer to order, had to flag down other servers to get salt for the table (we had two peppers) and eventually the check because our server would not stop to check on us and would avoid eye contact when we tried to get her attention.",0,3,6,0,0

We visited on a Thursday night (we called ahead and put our name on the list, so we were seated immediately, which was nice).  I loved the atmosphere and though the restaurant was a little noisy, they seem to be trying to address that with acoustical material on the ceiling. It was busy so we certainly understood. The service was prompt and friendly.The food however lacked alot to be desired.  I ordered the braised beef over polenta (there was no explanation of what the preparation actually was) I assumed that meant cooked slowly in a liquid, stock, wine, herbs etc. ""My bad"". I was served what appeared to be beef shanks that were dry and tough and flavorless over polenta that was bland as well. The roasted mushrooms served along side were rubbery and inedible. Only having butter knives on the table is optimistic, however a sharp knife would not have improved the flavor.The manager offered to bring another plate, which I accepted thinking it must have been a fluke. While the second order was not dry, it was all fat and also tough. The item was removed from our check and the manager apologized profusely.Gauging from other reviews, being a new restaurant, inconsistency is a problem but I am sure being addressed.

The dumplings were fried chicken dumplings with a delicious gravy sauce! And the sushi was perfect for one person to get on top of some of the appetizers. However some things like the sweet potato and edamame and the chicken thigh skewers sounded good but were just ok. The sweet potato and edamame was basically puree sweet potato and edamame mixed together and then fried on the outside, and the chicken thighs were kind of cold. But it took about 6-7 items in order to fill us up, so it definitely has a tapas style.Drinks were very delicious.

From many places; Brazil, California, NY, Chicago, Atlanta, Texas, Florida, Seattle, Mexico, and many other places. I must suggest to the owners that in order to make this dining experience a better one for customers they should, first and foremost, call this place a tapas place.The portions are extremely small to be called dinner or lunch plates. I ordered the salmon sashimi (I've ordered this from many places around the world and was always served a portion of 5 or more pieces typically with wasabi and soy sauce on the side) and this was not provided...there were only 3 pieces in a watered down sauce I did not care for. My parents ordered dirty martinis which came in two different glasses (one a wine glass and one liqueur glass) and NOT martini glasses which demonstrated the lack of knowledge of the serving staff when it came to a fine dining experience. At an asian fusion sushi type place (what this restaurant was listed as) one expects that upon ordering rice they are going to get white japanese rice and my mother was served indian rice with her small pork portion.The creamy crab cakes also only came in 3 pieces. In conclusion, this was not a dinner this was a tapas/snack place. It's extremely over priced (the total came out to over 130 plus tip) and I only had a coke as there was no tea available. May I also state that we tried to make reservations and we also tried calling and we were not able to contact anyone from the restaurant. Upon arrival the hostess stated that reservations were closed but she would see if she could find us a table. Also in the time of covid and other germs going around it is not at all appropriate to use a dirty rag to wipe down tables especially during dining! (which our waiter did)",0,46,16,5,0

There are social distancing stickers on the floor, the staff wore masks and gloves. Upon arrival, there is an option on the door to scan the QR code in order to view the menu.  Otherwise, you will see a limited menu on the chalkboard inside.  There were paper menus near the cash register.  We ordered the short stacks and the Vegan bowl. Unfortunately, they were out of Tofu, so they were substituting with veggie sausage. We were also able to request veggie sausage with the short stacks as well.  There were quite a few tables available outside, so we choose to sit out and enjoy the breeze. It literally took them 10 minutes (maybe less) to bring out the food. It was delicious! The vegan bowl was not a hearty portion, but it was enough to make you satisfied.

Speaking of the happy hour, that is my favorite thing about Alchemy-- almost everything is half off during happy hour! Even the gigantic plate of house frites. I live in Spain, so I'm always happy to see the Spanish cava and Albariño on the wine menu, and when I want a cocktail I always have a crisis trying to decide between the Hound Dog and their different seasonal cocktails.

He was funny and had quick, efficient service. We started with the guacamole which they make table side. Was enough for all five of us to snack on and passed the California girl test (we know good guacamole). I had the mint2b julep Rita. Omg so good!!! Not too sweet, had a refreshing, tropical flavor. I tried my friend's drink ""lift your spirits"" also super tasty! This place has got some great, original cocktails. For food I ordered the lamb skewers. Definitely a 5/5. Tasted like kebabs. I also got a tuna taco. Some great crunchy pieces in there. 4/5 Tried some of my friends teriyaki steak skewers. Delicious!

I also had a short rib taco, it tasted great but the picked onions took over the flavor a lot and the $4 price tag was a bit high for a single taco in my opinion. My boyfriend got the crab cakes and he enjoyed them. We shared the spuds which are basically French fries and they were so good too.

We were greeted immediately, seated promptly, and our waiter came over super upbeat and positive. After a couple suggested dishes, we settled on the black eyed pea hummus, some tacos, and some street corn. Dear god - the flavor is amazing.

If you are staying downtown, it's defiantly a car or Uber/Lyft ride away (roughly $7-$9). Babalu is located outside of the craziness of Beale Street. Babalu is in Overton Square, which is a lovely area that I highly recommend checking out if you are visiting Memphis for a few days. This is a large restaurant with a lot of seating at the bar and in and outside. I came on a holiday around 1 pm and they were packed! There were so many appealing menu options, I didn't know what to choose. I finally decided on the chicken tacos and cheesy grits. Based off of how delicious those two dishes were, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. All ingredients were fresh, and both dishes were wildly full of flavor. Also, order the grits, honestly they are the best I've ever had. I love that the menu offers a lot of small plate options so you have the opportunity to try a lot of different things. I mean, the tacos are only $3.5 - $4 so how could you go wrong? I loved the look of this building and the decor inside. You feel like you are in a completely different space and time. It's clear a lot of care and thought went into every detail. Fun fact, this restaurant was named after Ricky Ricardo's signature song in my one my favorite all-time shows, ""I Love Lucy."" After hearing that, I had to visit. If I lived in the area, I'd be here all of the time. It's not overly fancy or expensive so it could easily be a regular place to eat. Why should you visit? If you haven't been convinced enough from my above review, I don't know what will change your mind.

I travel alone for work and I do look young, which I believe might have caused the server to give me less than favorable service. I was seated at the ""counter"" being that I was eating alone. My order was taken in a fair amount of time, though she never asked how I was doing or if I'd been to the restaurant before... or if I had any questions about the menu. My food was delivered quickly but I was never asked if I needed anything else. I was at the counter eating for about 45 minutes. This is a busy area, as the food window was right next to me as well as the service station for drinks. I was never spoken to after my food was delivered by either my server or others that passed by. The server dropped off my check and I had to grab her attention to ask if I should pay with her or at the front. She said ""either."" I pulled out my corporate card right away and over a 15 minute period, it was never picked up. I then went to the front to pay, where I was immediately greeted and assisted.

Her- oh ok just asking we have people make reservations walking into the restaurant all the time. Umm okSo then we get seated in a tiny corner by the door. Fine!We ordered drinks which were good. Got the cheeses appetizer. They brought it out and same said girl mumbled something about what the cheeses were then walked off. It had 3 cheeses on it which were good but they only gave us 4 crouton sized pieces of bread. So after the 2nd bite I was eating just cheese. Don't know if you have ever had blue cheese or Brie without a cracker but it ain't fun.Then the entrees came -The beef bourg was good but plain egg noodles as a side it just weird and not needed.We also had the fish of the day with risotto. First bite of fish had a bone - not the way to start but no more after that and it was a decent piece of fish. Risotto was bland.2nd observation was EVERYTHING had zero seasoning. I don't think they have ever heard of salt or pepper.Finally, we ordered a chocolate crepe for dessert.

It was juicy, and I have not had duck like that in a while.  It was pleasant.  I mixed up the egg, fries, and greens together and ate them like a barbarian- went down like a champ!  It was worth the wait.  Dessert was offered, but we decided to go down the street for more drinks and dessert.This is a solid place to go out to eat.  It was relaxing, and I enjoyed it thoroughly, with the company I was with.  I will be sure to go back!  Be mindful though dinner here is slower paced, and they do not rush, so if you want something quick, this may not be for you!",0,1824,1584,4898,1

We got here early on Saturday at 5PM when they opened since we did not have a reservation. We were promptly seated near the entrance at a window seat. I liked the natural light and it was good for my photos. It has a very casual vibe inside with some interesting decor. Parking was a little confusing, but we parked at the fresh market and walked over. The food at this place was great. I really enjoyed everything I ordered, plus the complementary bread with balsamic and olive oil dip was delicious. So delicious that we got a second, no, a third basket! It's addicting. Food:Mussels - they were so savory and full of flavor. The white wine sauce was a perfect balance to the mussels, and the crispy croutons on top were a great pairing. $12.50Ham & Gruyere baked chicken - this entrée comes with a side of mash and gravy with asparagus. The potatoes were smooth and the gravy reminded me of thanksgiving. I really liked the add of the ham inside the chicken because it added a nice salty taste to the breast meat. $18.50Pan seared mahi mahi special - this dish was excellent. I would order this again if I could, since it was a special. The mahi was cooked well, and came out nice and flakey. It was filling and light. $24Cheesecake - definitely recommend this dessert. It is so creamy and thick. And the amaretto with fruit sauce is a great addition to break up the creaminess a bit. It's not too sweet either. Yum. $7Overall, 4 stars for great service and food.

Called in at open at 3:30pm to arrange reservations for 4. The only slots were 5:30 or 8pm unless we wanted the table by the kitchen door. We opted for 5:30... Very early but we wanted to avoid being seated In a noisy high traffic area. We arrived at 5:25 to an empty restaurant. We tracked down the hostess who then pored over the list then walked is to the only other table in the hall by the kitchen. I explained we arrived early to avoid such a table. She acted very put out and spent 5-7 minutes between the list and the back room... Nearly every table is a 4 top and none were occupied. What the hell. We finally get a table by the door. Okay. Our server was nice but very slow and quickly was overwhelmed by his 2 tables. Drinks were slow. Food was slow. Table touches were few and far between. One of my favorites, French onion soup, was average at best. Scant onions and the cheese was exceptionally clumpy. The broth was lacking flavor. The mussels app was very good. Great broth/base and properly cooked. Entrees came out and my grouper was good but slightly overcooked so it was tough on the thinner ends of the filet. Overall it was good but not great. My date's scallops were quite undercooked. To the point we questioned if they were safe to eat. $25 for 3 scallops you'd think they could cook them properly. Have to add that we struggled to hear each other over the din. For the style of place it is, the noise was a bit much. Had to flag down the server to get our checks. Overall some highlights but overall a disappointing experience on the food and service front. I'd go 2.5 here for the mussels and the accompaniments to the grouper, but forced to round it's got to be down. We won't be back.",2,173,139,350,0

When we arrived, the restaurant was empty. We were greeted by a hostess and mentioned we had a reservation for a table in the bar. We were told: ""We don't usually sit parties of two at tables in the bar area but you can sit up at the bar if you'd like."" This was odd, as we'd been seated in the bar on previous occasions (especially when we've had a reservation). When we mentioned we didn't want to sit up at the bar and preferred a table, she said: ""How about here?"" - and offered up a two-top, in the main dining room, jammed into a corner next to another two-top. Standing in this empty restaurant, after making a reservation, and being told we couldn't sit in the only area of the restaurant we like, my wife and I simply left. We then rang up a highly respected restaurant a few blocks away, explained our predicament and they welcomed us with open arms - seating us at a table in their bar area.

But, it's tough to like it no matter how hard you try because their space is very cold, uncomfortable, unpleasant, etc. There are only bar stools inside (I was hoping to sit in a big comfy chair that I saw in another Yelper's review photos, I guess they've done away with these), and outside there are cheap patio type chairs. And the outside- what is up with this? There are table and chairs, but very little in the way of shade. We are in Memphis, and the sun is blinding and will melt you. Some more shade would be nice.      They have 20 something taps. On most of the taps flow local brews from Tennessee and surrounding states, with an occasional tap utilized for brews from further away (the day of my visit they had beers from DogFish Head and Bell's) Most of the beer I tried was very good, I stuck to Tennessee breweries and I was impressed by what the volunteer state is brewing. The bartender the day of my visit was extremely nice and I saw him help out many a beer novice with selecting their brews, this is always such a nice thing to see happening at a beer bar.     There is a lot of potential for this place, but someone needs to up their game on how they design the interior (and add some shade for the outside seating). I would definitely come back here, but if it is the same seating and interior setup I wouldn't stay the 3 hours I did on my visit here this time.",0,109,582,36,0

We were going to eat at a local restaurant in the area but they were on a wait. Seems like everywhere you go these days you have to have a reservation. Ugh! So I asked my wife about the restaurant she went to a couple of weeks ago, Magnolia and May. We were basically in the same parking lot so we walked over and asked to be seated. The hostess was very nice and even though we didn't have reservations, she was able to seat us on the patio. The patio was very nice and the music on the overhead speakers was enjoyable. Our waitress was great. She suggested a couple of appetizers for us to try with our adult beverages. We had the jalapeño poppers and the buffalo broccoli. OMG! I mean, wow! Different and delicious. Loved the variety of appetizers. Unfortunately we had a late lunch and were almost full. We watched the main dishes come out to the people around us and everything looked colorful, plentiful, and delicious. We decided to get the rest of the appetizers to go and try the donut sundae they offer. Again, we weren't disappointed. The restaurant was clean, the patio was clean, and the restrooms were nice and clean as well. Staff was very friendly.

All staff were wearing masks and required you to wear inside the restaurant. Food wise, we got a random sampling of things, which were all good. I would categorize their menu as southern style. I would recommend:1. Buffalo Broccoli - steamed broccoli with a buffalo batter. I normally don't go for buffalo flavored items because they are too spicy. But this was the perfect amount of spice for someone who like very low spice. The broccoli was perfectly cooked as well. They have ranch and blue cheese dipping sauces as well2. Grilled Peach and Cherry Tomato Salad - in addition to the grilled peaches and cherry tomatoes, it comes with a whipped goat cheese spread.

I love there food!I found this place in YELP and it was the 1st stop I made upon arriving to Memphis from Atlanta. And boy oh boy...what a great to go to for a quick unique tasteful bite! I had a list of 3-4 items I was going to try but, after seeing there prices I settled for just one...otherwise I would of found myself spending $30-50 for all 4 items. I decided to get the Meatloaf Slider w/potato salad and a Arnold Palmer Tea and I made the best decision. (Potato salad was not as sweet and potato's were not as soft as I like mine.)We set outside as we awaited our food to be brought out to the picnic tables outback & I'll leave my video to say the REST! But I'll add...we had random people coming to us & asking what we ordered and excited about our food. The meatloaf slider w/what I think was a dab of the peach habanero jam made the slider the best I've ever had. My friend grubbed down on her fish taco ($10) and her other item. Customers & staff were so overly friendly, nothing like that southern hospitality and we felt it as soon as we arrived to this place. NOTE: Food was so goo that the day we left to return back to Atlanta...we stopped to pick up some road food for lunch! Yessssss it's that good that I been reminiscing off the meatloaf slider & jam that I wish I would of purchased.

The bun was super soft, and plenty of delicious toppings.My wife tried the shrimp and andouille po'boy. Remember, she's an honorary* Cajun, so if she likes something with shrimp and andouille sausage, you know it's good. Well, she couldn't stop raving about it, saying it is her new favorite thing. The bread was soft, not crusty like typical po'boys, but they do toast it, so you get some texture. The amount of shrimp, sausage, and other filling was substantial. You're not getting cheated with this sandwich.We have tried several things on the menu over the years, and each item is better than the last. If you're driving through Memphis and want to eat local, you will not regret stopping here.

I'd heard my parents talk about Elwood's Shack for months so I was thrilled when my mom surprised us with the Shaq attack, a barbecue lover's dream, when we landed in the city. There was a 1/2 bbq chicken, pulled pork, ribs, sausage, brisket, and wings. Yes!We were thankful for the sides and texas toast but we were all about the meat. We dug into the spread that was topped with a classic Memphis dry rub and a little of their sauce. Each offering had a distinct taste and the food was cooked very well. The ribs were literally falling off of the bone, just the way I like it. The brisket was moist, the pork was tender, the 1/2 chicken was juicy, the sausage was nicely smoked, and the wings had a little kick to them. This was great barbecue!We also tried the fish tacos. Initially I was a little skeptical of fish tacos with avocado at a bbq spot but the trout was so well seasoned and it was topped with pico de gallo, greens, and a horseradish sauce. It was all sitting on a beautiful baked tortilla that I could've eaten all by itself.At some point, I'd like to visit Elwood's to see what else is cookin' and smokin' over there.

He was a complete germ-o-phobe. The kind of person that wouldn't let you wear shoes inside the house, wouldn't let his kids eat pork (cause dirty), the whole bit. One day, his American wife and Persian/American daughter coerced him to go eat in a trailer parked in a Lowe's parking lot. The wife and daughter had heard the trailer had great fish tacos. After a few drinks, he said ok. The first time he went, he had the taco and was stuffed and super happy. He loved it. Everything was perfect and he went home dreaming of tacos to come. A few days later, J suggests going back to the trailer parked in the Lowe's parking lot to have another taco. He orders his taco, waits for a while, and then the steelhead trout taco appears. J was so excited about his taco that he grabs it with such anticipation and excitement that it falls to the floor......... everyone's breath stopped. J looked down onto the floor that had his precious taco on it, picks it up with all the innards scraped off of the floor and inserted it INTO HIS MOUTH. This taco was so damn good to J that he picked up up off the floor of this place and ate it.  Need I say more? This steelhead trout taco will make a person change.

Very clean lines & warm. The service is fantastic, truly flawless.Our party of 3 - my husband, 89YO mom and I terrified the staff when mom AND I took a tumble on our way up to their front patio entrance (watch the ramp, it has a bit of a drop off on the side - for most people NOT a problem).A doctor customer came out and checked her out, asked her some questions & pronounced her most likely fine, and much to the consternation of the servers, we came on in for dinner (this time WITH walker). Huge thanks and kudos to the servers and owner who rushed out to my mom's side as soon as we tumbled bringing her ice water and ice & napkins for her head. So my sweet little ole mom, with a slight bit of blood in her silver hair, calmly sat and chatted with us, our neighbors at each side and the servers. She enjoyed a lovely meal out - always a special treat in such a sweet place.We started with a shared sampler tray of cheeses (blue, an English cheddar, and a soft white, salami, proscuitto, HOUSE MADE SAUSAGE - my favorite!! - and capicola with mustard and tapenade). We all agreed it was perfection, though the bread took some getting used to - it was crunchy-ish, a little sweet almost more like a cookie than toasted bread. Unexpected but we liked it once we ""got used to it"".I followed with the Goat Cheese Salad: farm stand lettuce, goat cheese and rosemary walnuts and the chorizo bolognese. I loved everything. Mom & Hubs had the Cioppino Seafood Stew, sadly a disappointment. The stew was more of a thick tomato sauce and nary a piece of fish, save a few shrimp that mom pronounced ""sad and mushy"". Still overall, a very good experience.Thank goodness for the lovely doctor who gave us the ok to skip out on the ER visit. And, he was right - she was just fine. We treated the doc & his wife to a bottle of wine, but I'll tell you people in Memphis are amazingly friendly and helpful. This couple was almost horrified that I paid part of their bill without asking because it was ""simply unnecessary"".My husband enjoyed a local draft, and I gulped down a couple glasses of a delicious French chardonnay (still freaking out over the fall) and big glasses of Pellegrino.

Had never been here ... been to Bounty on Broad many times just down the sidewalk but never Maximos. Went last night and had one of the best meals and best times out in a very long time. I was surprised... almost blown away by how good the food was. We had several different plates and they were all great! The biggest issue was that there were so many other items that sounded delicious. It was a struggle to narrow them down. Even the dessert at the end was great. Home made coconut ice cream was the best ice cream I've ever had... really. Service was also outstanding. I know this review sounds a little over the top .... It was just a really good night. Can not wait to go back again and try some of the other items.,6,15,2,10,0

Maximo's on Broad is a locally owned, small and intimate Tapas & Wine Bar. If you are watching your budget, Maximos is $$  moderately priced with a  menu ranging from small plate tapas to your customary entrees.Let us answer this question for you.   A tapa is an appetizer or snack of Spanish cuisine, so it could be translated as a small portion of any kind of food.The bar also features local beers  on tap and handcrafted cocktails.  The restaurant hours of operation are 5 - 9 Tuesday thru Thursday &  5 - 10 Friday & Saturday. Located at 2617 Broad Avenue, Memphis, TN near Broadway Pizza .Maximum ExperienceThis was our first time at Maximos on Broad.  We had researched this place online and were dismayed by the lack of reviews. We thought of cancelling our reservation but thank goodness we did not. We had an amazing meal, fantastic drinks, and great service . Our waitress was courteous and pretty knowledgeable about the menu options and attended to us adequately. The atmosphere is a nice mix of eclectic pieces including the  artwork displayed throughout the restaurant. We wouldn't describe Maximos as a family/kid friendly type of outing, but more of a place for date night, a couples gathering or a friendly hangout with friends. Maximum Goodness The food was undeniably scrumptious! My stuffed chicken and risotto was delish!   I have to admit the red pepper  sauce presentation was not so appealing. However after tasting the entire combination of flavors (chicken, sauce, risotto, butter, onion & parmesan cheese ), it was fye! Mr. Jones's brandied glaze pork chop entree was juicy and a satisfying combination of sweet and savory. He really liked the chickpeas and Brussels sprouts.We had to forgo dessert this time but will definitely return to try the Bread Pudding.",0,0,12,0,0

I loved the vibe of this bar- it's very down to earth with delicious food and great wine. This seems to me like it would be a great first meeting place. I love how you can order a few of the tapas style with your wine or decide to order a full on entree. We loved the raviolo, stuffed chicken, risotto cakes, and the short rib special.

So, of course, all things in our lives revolve around food. We went here this past Friday evening because I'd received a new job offer...and what better way to celebrate than with drinks and food?! We arrived a little after 7:00 without reservations. The place wasn't empty but it wasn't crowded. Happy hour was ending so it was a nice young professional crowd at the bar and a few tables. We were sat immediately and had a very nice server (I forgot her name but she was older and took her job as a server very seriously). We both have a shellfish allergy so our menu options were kinda limited. Fortunately, we glanced at the menu and were prepared for the experience. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and two tapas: lamb satay with brussels and chickpeas; and raviolo with a red sauce. My husband had one of their signature drinks and the chef's special, which in Friday was a t-bone with truffle fries and green beans. We LOVED everything except the raviolo. It was bland and could use more pizazz. The lamb satay was perfect! I all but licked the plate clean. My husband's steak was huge; green beans cooked to perfection. The truffle fries, on the other had, tasted more like store-bought frozen season fries. Definitely didn't get a truffle flavor and definitely didn't taste or look hand cut. Overall, we enjoyed the dining experience and would return. While there were a couple of disappointing moments, we enjoyed the impromptu celebration.

The hush puppies were the best option. Sweet potatoes were nothing special, and the lamb meatballs were lacking umph in the spice. Bread was fine.For mains, my duck was cooked to perfection. Seasoned, crispy skin and a perfect medium well at my request. However the rest of the dish was nothing special and not very flavorful. The greens were unfortunately gritty so I left them uneaten, and when I brought this to the attention of the server, he told me it was probably the spices. It didn't seem that way to me since I ate the spices on the duck, but I didn't want to argue. Mixed reviews around the table - veal pasta was under seasoned/nothing special/more pasta and less meat than expected. Fish was good but not amazing. Pork tenderloin was very good.We skipped dessert since we had something planned at home. Also although the server was friendly and helpful with questions, little details fell through - like serving appetizers without small plates or serving spoons (needed for the non-hush puppy apps), both for which we had to request and wait just long enough to be awkward. We were also short one cocktail and waiting to make a toast longer than expected. Overall just small details that for the price and reputation you would expect you wouldn't have to manage.So in short, for all the hype and well of course considering the price, our special occasion dinner didn't feel that special. No wow moments from my guests, difficulty hearing even just across the table for our group of 8, and small oversights that you wouldn't expect from a restaurant with this reputation.",0,106,137,47,1

I love traveling and eating and Yelping for food! I usually don't write reviews unless something is incredible or it's the opposite, disrespectfully terrible. In this case, Restaurant Iris gets reviewed for the latter. Let me just start by telling you I've eaten here before and it went well. During that visit, I remember having the lobster knocked appetizer and loved it so much that we ordered a second one. Lately, I'd been craving it and made plans to drive 30 minutes to grab a lobster knuckle roll. I ordered my roll to go and was so excited when they brought it out... too excited to wait until I got home to eat it. I sat in my car, opened the to-go brown box and started eating. I hadn't eaten much all day so I was hungry and eating fast. Just as I got ready to take another bite, I noticed what I prayed was not before my eyes. Yes, it was mold, and lots of it. Wow- talk about disgusting. Imagine the feeling you get after eating something you soon realize is molded. Gross doesn't not begin to describe the feeling. I sat there in disbelief replaying everything... my decision to drive 30 minutes, and wait until they were open because they open during the evening at 4pm or 5pm. I couldn't believe it... real mold on real food that I was eating form a real ""5-star like"" restaurant. Real disappointment. I can't recall what was more disappointing, the fact that I was eating bread with mold all over it or after getting out of my car, walking back inside to show management, and hearing the staff member/management tell me, ""It could be from the stone they use to cook with or it could be mold. None of the other pieces had anything on them. Would you like another one?"" Dear sir, even Stevie Wonder knows what's on this bread. How insulting... - Dear management, for future reference, how about, ""I'm so sorry this happened, how can we make this experience a better one? ..."" For the record, I did get my money back after I asked. I don't think I should have had to ask but hey... eat at your own risk. After all, ""it could be the stone"" also known as mold.  You decide.

We will not come back until Chef English revises the menu. First, let me say service is impeccable. Restaurant is inviting, although the updates are not my style - the changes to the bar area are fantastic...because there is actually a bar area now. Prior to the revamp, this was such a gem. My husband and I ate here probably two -three times a year. We always loved the surf and turf and lobster sandwich. These stables are GONE!. The new menu is ""too cool for school"". Lots of fancy ingredients, but flavor and appeal, lacking. STARTERS:First, you now have to buy bread for $6. It isn't worth $6. It comes with honey butter and warm fig jam, but the bread itself if just okay. Save the $6. We then had gnocchi stuffed with potato and something - it was okay, nothing I would have again. The sauce was heavy and oily. Then we had baby octopus. We didn't finish it. The aioli sauce is what makes it taste good, but, again, the flavors weren't there. ENTREE:I had baked Cod. Husband had ribeye (he really wanted the surf and turf pictured in many of the posts here). I took two bites of the cod and that was it - terrible. Lets just say I'd rather have farmed raised tilapia from Tugs bar and grill downtown. The ribeye was okay, but the rice whatever it came on tasted like cardboard. Usually Chef English greets his patrons, but not this time. Perhaps he has had terrible feedback?So disappointed, Iris.

For example one course was a single ravioli in a bowl of sauce and we had to share it!  One ravioli or maybe two per person would have been more appropriate for this course. After all courses were served I was still hungry. When ordering the tasting menu the chef chooses the plates specifically to accommodate your allergies and preferences, which is nice.  I wonder if this had anything to do with the incongruous food selections. Our waitress was extremely pleasant , very accommodating and explained the dishes and accompanying wines well. As for the wines they were fair, but also not great.

For entrees, we had the Gulf Shrimp and Rice Grits Congee, which had sausage and boiled peanuts added to it. My wife does not like standard grits - these tasted much more of the rice and were surprisingly good! I had the Kobe beef flat iron steak, with Mozzarella bread pudding. The steak was excellent - This was the first time tasting Kobe so I was looking forward to a melt-in-your mouth experience.

Menu by Chef Kelly English paired with Fess Parker wines. At 62 Cooper St. Iris Etc (test kitchen & dining facility)These are fun events. Chef English presented each dish and representatives from Fess Parker talked about each wine. I'm much more interested in hearing the Chef even though I'm something of a Cork Dork. Chef English has a good sense of humor. Often times the winery peeps talk about hang time (of the grapes, not Michael Jorden) or malolactic fermentation (who cares)!Guacamole de Jalisco with Lobster Claws, Shrimp & Pea Shoots. Nicely presented, perfectly cooked shrimp. Sauced with a slightly spicy, very smooth, balanced guacamole. Topped with fresh pea shoots. Very well balanced, Kelly English's ability showed throughout.Paired with Marcella's White Blend. Good and crisp, pretty fruity. Nice Match. A poolside wine on a hot day. Retails for about $18. I'd buy it.Redfish Ronan with Mantequilla Negra, Citris, Pepita, charred Tomatillos and orzotta de elote y congreto. If this dish ever sees the menu, they're going to have to shorten the name! Just typing it was a pain in the butt. On the other hand this was damn delicious. Chef substituted Orzo (orzotta) for the more usual risotto. Lightens it up a little. This isn't as pretty a dish, but it more than makes up for appearance with knock out flavors.Paired with Ashley's Vineyard Pinot Noir. I never ""got"" Pinots & ive been ""lucky"" enough to have tasted some of the finest Burgundy on the planet. Guess I'm a Barbarian. With Pinot it's kind of like dating someone who is bipolar-you never know what you're going to get until you open the door (or the bottle)! I apologize to all you sophisticated Pinot drinkers out there-I'm a little jealous that I'm just too whatever. This wine showed REALLY well. If all Pinot tasted like this I could take my place among the Pinot lovers-happily. Black currant fruit, nice balance with just enough acid. Retails for $50. Guess thats what gets me. If I pay $50 for a California Zin or a blend I'll get a ""superior"" glass of red wine. Bananas and CoconutsAs much as the previous dish was ""over described"" this is under. What it is... a banana muffin with a little chili pepper infused. A sauce based on coconut milk with shaved coconut. Sounds odd, especially the pepper. This kind of flavoring combo is pretty ""in vogue"" in the food world and it often works-it does pretty well here. Definitely NOT an attractive dish on the plate. Kind of looks like a turd with some white stuff in the middle.This dish was partially saved by the excellent Fess Parker Santa Barbara Riesling that was served. Nicely sweet with a nearly perfect, slightly acidic balance. A REAL winner!!! Retails for $12-14. Get some!I'm not sure I can tell you how to get invited to these.

I ordered the Dare ya, which was a beef burger with onion, lettuce, tomato bacon and acre sauce.  For 12 bucks. The burger patty was maybe 4-6 ounces, two tiny pieces of bacon, and a couple pieces of lettuce and onion. The flavor was okay, there was a lot of sauce on the bun that took away from the taste of the burger patty.  The patty itself wasn't thin like a smash burger, but it wasn't very thick either. Normally a good compromise thickness wise, but just not enough meat. My wife had the early rise which was a beef burger, black pepper aioli, (a piece) of Bibb lettuce, a sunny side up egg, served on two sweet potato waffles. The price was 13.50. Too much for what you got. The waffles, while delicious, were too much in comparison to the small patty. Fries are an extra item...while I love they are hand cut, they have a seasoning that is very pepper heavy- fine for my wife and I, NOT for our kids. There is no mention of this either during the ordering /checkout process. So, our picky 6 year old was not a fan of them, but did like his Peanut Butter sandwich. The chicken nuggets, were a hit with our two year old.  They had great breading and great flavor. It's been a few years since we've been here (when they were new), but I don't think we will be coming back. $60 for lunch for a family of 4 is pretty steep, for food that really isn't anything to write home about.

I ordered from this location via Ubereats and my order was fresh, hot and juicy - EXACTLY like (or maybe even better?) you'd expect when dining in.I ordered the mild Hot Chicken sandwich with pimento Mac and cheese (~$11). I made a slight modification to the sandwich and got coleslaw on the side instead of on the sandwich as prepared. I'm not a fan of butter bread pickles, which also on the sandwich. The pickles personally didn't add or takeaway anything from the eating experience. Besides that, everything was delicious! The fried chicken was juicy, crunchy and had the right amount of spice. The bun was buttery and toasted. And the comeback sauce (mayo + hot sauce) added an additional zing! Oftentimes, I worry about getting a fried chicken sandwich delivered because so much could go wrong - the bread or chicken can get soggy - but everything was perfect! Ok, now let's get into this pimento Mac and cheese - this thing will change. your. life. I don't think y'all heard me. This pimento Mac and cheese will CHANGE. YOUR. LIFE.

We've been loyal customers since this location opened because I was obsessed with it in Nashville--we literally waiting in line for 2+ hours on opening night! We've brought family and friends here from out of town on countless occasions. We went last night after enjoying a day out around town with our dogs. They were out of chicken tenders (okay, I get that, no big deal I guess), but we able to serve us sandwiches with two big tenders on them...? They also didn't have any drinks available from the fountain, including water, which isn't great when eating hot chicken. However, the most annoying and saddening part of our visit was that we were told not once, but TWICE, that since they enclosed their outdoor patio, our dogs were not supposed to be there as it was now considered ""indoors"" but they'd let it slide this time. This struck us as odd, as they used their now enclosed patio as an ""outdoor"" dining area to comply with covid regulations, yet it is considered indoor when dogs are involved...?So truly, I get all of the events in isolation and can look past them singularly, but the combination of the three made for a really terrible experience. And all I could think about is how Hopdoddy--a great TX local restaurant that expanded to MEM-- just closed due to terrible service just down the road from HB... this will be Hatti B's if all nights become like last night.

We love Hatti B's. We really do, like we're obsessed. We've been to numerous of these locations all over Tennessee and Georgia. Unfortunately this one didn't quite hit the spot for me.  Customer service first: they were very nice. The staff had kind speaking voices and were gentle to customers when someone breaks the new restaurant policies with COVID19 restrictions in line. They were also helpful with our meals and super speedy!  Now the food: I really don't know what was up. Was it my taste palate? Or was it a bad batch that day? My sandwich was incredibly salty and I couldn't enjoy it as I wish I could have. The crispiness was still there but the saltiness of it completely masked it's usual buttery goodness. The cole slaw was a bit bland too. The only thing that did save the day were the fries. It hit all the right spots and was just what I wanted out of them. Overall, I just wish I had a better foodie experience here!

Drive in the eve is only about 8 mins which was ok for me because I didn't want to venture to far out. Atmosphere: To start, parking was horrible. I hope they'll get an opportunity to add more spaces because that can scare people from visiting and missing a great opportunity to eat this good food. (We almost left but glad we didn't). Once we got inside, we were greeted by a nice young man that took our order, we got our number & seated ourselves at a table. Distancing wasn't a problem so that was great. Plenty of seating. Food: Too much hot spices are not my friend so we just elected for mild, large dark, added 3 wings, side of greens, baked beans and the pimento Mac n cheese.

My order was taken and the gentleman then came to the table to confirm my Yelp pass and take my name. Now the food was bit interesting. The lady brought my food along with my cousins was showing and telling us what the sauces were. She kept saying my name while giving me a order. Only to find out once I got home and opening the bag it wasn't my order. Now, I had to call my cousin, Camille, to meet up and swap bags because we both had each others food. lol... After swapping bags and returning back home. The food was fabulous... I had to the spicy shrimp bowl and California rolls... I truly enjoyed the food and I will make a return visit.

The Cove you are my jam! This is the kind of bar that feels like a home away from home. It gives off the comfortable feeling. And appears to have a fair amount of regulars. Also there an old man aquatic theme and I'm a sucker for the look. My flight from NY was a few hours earlier than my friend's flight. I decided on popping into the Cove for a cold one. At the entrance they mentioned a $5 cover for the music. According to the hostess the fiddler playing was one of the best in Memphis and always draws in a crowd. She was right. The place was full. I had to ask to share a table. The hummus in the menu is just that...hummus. But if you get the Mediterranean platter then you get a wonderful spread of roasted red peppers, olives, artichoke heart, eggplant tapenade and tons of pita. Delicious! I was more than happy with my spread. There was also some local beers such as ""Ghost River Gold"" to pick from. The band started while I was eating dinner and it was just the right amount of energy. Felt appropriate to listen to the famous Memphis fiddler on my first day in. By the time my friend arrived, I was in the patio warmth chatting it up with Emmett. What a ham! Later he treated my friend and I to some tasty cocktails. Michael, the bartender knows how to craft up a fancy beverage for sure. I got a Sazerac that hit the spot. We returned our last night and Nelson, our bartender was just as hilarious and welcoming. There was also a chatty chef and a lady who might have been ""three sheets to the wind"".

I wanted punchier flavours and instead it was watered down. The ginger marinated in damera sugar was a bright spot but otherwise the drink was just meh. One other bright side was that it was reasonably priced!I'm giving an extra star for ambiance and comfy seats and great acoustics - they had a live band start up while I was there, and yet I didnt have to shout at my friends acroos the table to get heard. Also really liked the nautical theme - it was charming without being kitschy. The coup de grace was that the TV was tuned to Turner Movie Classics and our table had fun and a brief segue-way conversation about 1940s fashions for men and women.

You have an hour and thirty minute max time limit when dining abs they do ask that if not eating or drinking to have your mask on. I do feel as though this is a nice date spot . I love it and will be back again.",6,22,14,19,0

We couldn't be seated until the entire party (4 people) were there so we ended up having to wait. We were finally seated and watched the wait staff pass us by without a word of acknowledgement (one waiter was sagging so bad you could see his underwear every time he walked by). When he was asked about ""who our waiter was"" he straight up ignored us and continued on walking while pulling up his pants. We reached out to CJ, the manager, who was surprised that we were still waiting but she took our order for us (7:50PM). (8PM) : I ordered the Blackened Catfish with Greens + Side of Fries + Robin Givens  (Manhattan).  M ordered the Fried Catfish with Greens + Betty Davis/Jezebel. MO ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana (Parmesan) + Robin Givens (Manhattan). D ordered the Shrimp and Grits and Cajun Chicken Egg Rolls. (8:10PM): The drinks were brought out promptly along with waters. The drinks were ok but made pretty strong that the alcohol overpowered the other flavors (some people may enjoy this but we didn't). Nevertheless, we had something while waiting on our food. (9:00PM): At this point, there were many patrons that were upset with the lack of service, etc. as we could hear people complaining (one group even told us they had been there since 5:30PM and finally was leaving). (9:10PM): We are STILL waiting for our food and asked Ms. CJ ""how much longer would it be"". She was confused as to why we hadn't received our order and knew she put it in because we received our drinks. A few minutes later (9:14PM) the cook came out, asked us what we ordered, and we had to repeat our order with much frustration. We finally received our food at 9:30PM (they close at 10PM).The flavor was there, on most of the items, with a few mishaps. The Egg Rolls were soggy and lukewarm as if they had been sitting out. The Greens were TERRIBLE.... crunchy and hard to eat with the cornbread WELL overdone. My Blackened Catfish was lukewarm but the Fries were good (fresh out the fryer). M's Fried Catfish was good (fresh out the fryer) + she had the Greens (see above). M's Eggplant Parmesan was good (marinara and cheese) until you got to the Eggplant which didn't have any flavor at all. To have waited 1.5 hours for food and it turn out to be lackluster was VERY disappointing. Ms. CJ was very professional and apologetic despite what she had to work with (staff) this evening. She made sure we were taking care of that night once it was time to leave and for a future visit. She seemed very determined to provide a good experience and for that we were forgiving. Like the other reviews, the food is there (despite some issues) BUT the service is TERRIBLE.. and for that I wouldn't come back. I knew ahead of time that we could experience a wait (read the reviews) but tonight was a DISASTER. *The highlight of the evening was the live singer/band and one of the workers watched us walk out to our cars to make sure we were safe (we literally were the last group there). *They did check temperatures, had tables blocked off for distancing, and enforced wearing of masks. Do better Mahogany, do better, smh (shaking my head). We had to laugh to keep from being upset!",10,78,160,342,1

So while waiting for my table, I couldn't get a drink. Ok fine. I ordered the catfish and greens. The food arrived at the table at different times when it was ready. It was definitely hot and fresh.

The chicken (breast and wing) was awful. Heavily battered with almost burnt crust. Inside was rubbery and absolutely flavorless. Brought it home to skin and wash off for the dog. He'll probably be writing a similar review about it later. And how do you mess up a cornbread cake?

New experience for me as all the other times were wonderful. Told server immediately I was a vegetarian and asked to modify something. Was told that they can not modify. Okay, that was never my experience before, but new rule, okay, fine. Then asked about pumpkin soup. Said it was great so I ordered that. Ordered a grain dish and veggie. Soup came...tasted like bacon. Asked, turns out soup has pork in it. Asked to be made without pork. No problem. Comes back 5 minutes later. It's made with chicken stock. No soup for me. 20 minutes go by...I get to thinking, I wonder if the grain dish I ordered is vegetarian. Google the menu...nope. 5 minutes later server is serving the dish and I ask if it's vegetarian. She states she was just thinking about that and no it's not. And then attempts to leave it on the table. I went and spoke with, I believe, the owner who told me they do modify dishes and apologized, but this was just a straight up hot mess. Usually if I go out of my way to tell a server I'm a vegetarian and avoid meat and fish, they look out for me and don't try to serve me dishes with meat twice, especially at upscale restaurants. It was just a crappy, weird experience. Especially since no one ever attempted to fix it or make it right or offer to make me something different. She did ask me if I wanted to order a salad after the soup disaster (that I'm sure I would have paid for and the same salad I had already told her I wasn't interested in when I originally placed my order). I've had bad experiences at restaurants in my life, but it's the way they are handled that always makes it or breaks it for me. Mistakes happen, I get it. It's how you handle the mistake that matters and saves a customer, in this case, from a crappy, ruined night...especially now when a lot of people are not going out as frequently.

I still (a week later) can't stop thinking about this wine!  It paired very well with the grilled porterhouse (pork),  Oh.My.God good - yes, it was that good!  It was served with ham hock sautéed cabbage, fingerling potatoes and a crushed tomato sauce.  I was already getting full by this time, but I cleaned my plate anyway... (so good I forgot to take a photo!)And since I still had a bit of this delectable wine left, I ordered dessert!  The dark chocolate mouse cake which was dense and rich and oh, so delish.

The restaurant is in what seems like a residence but has a great layout for a small event such as this where we were able to seat everyone in two different adjoined rooms. When it came time for the toasts, everyone was able to assemble in the main room. There is an outdoor patio that easily holds the 75 people and where we had a band to perform during the cocktail hour. Acre arranged the menu so that each dish had a Persian influence as my wife is from Iran. We had a very fine artichoke truffle soup followed by a shirazi salad. This was followed by our main courses served family style where we had salmon with spinach biryani, duck with eggplant sauce, lamb shanks and strip steak.  Each were served on platters where our guests were able to pass around and enjoy.

Would definitely be back for another date night. We ordered kimchi fries. It was okay. It includes quite a good amount of beef and cheese but it made our fries soggier than I would like. Our fries were definitely not crunchy. I would not order this again when I go back. For main, I ordered the duck because I was craving a really good, crispy duck. ACRE really delivers. My duck was crispy and perfectly pink in the middle. I ordered medium and it was just right. The collard green, navy beans and cornbread was good but not astounding and it doesn't really go with the duck. I finished it nevertheless. For dessert, I ordered the sticky toffee date cake. Came out really hot goes really well with the ice cream. It was a little too sweet for me and it didn't really taste special. I prefer the sticky toffee pudding from the kitchen on shelby farms instead. Will try a different dessert next time. I also tried the acre royale and loved it! I am a new wine drinker and have been sticking to sweet wines like moscato. If you love super sweet wine, you'd love the acre royale. Overall I think ACRE is perfect for a fancy night out in memphis.

This is the feel of the world-famous Hernando's Hideaway. In a very unassuming location off of Elvis Presley Boulevard, just two blocks off of i-240, Hernando's is tucked away from the main road. The feel immediately, upon walking in is honky-tonk meets dive bar. Warm amber lights and colorful accent lights tickle the senses and hug the soul. The bar has friendly staff and servers, and touts his own fantastic cocktail menu. (Try the TCB, it's like foreplay in a glass.)This was my first foray to this new-to-me venue, to enjoy some friends performing drag to classic country songs. I understand they have music on the regular, and after the drag show the house band picked up and carried the energy to the end of the night. I will have to research the bands that are coming up, because I think if they are rock and roll enough I can even convince my husband to come out with me! The food was pretty basic, I was really hoping to get a peanut butter banana and bacon sandwich that was on the old menu, but the updated menu is a little slimmer. My friend's chicken sandwich was well seasoned and a little spicy. She said don't get the spicy because the original is plenty flavorful. Jalapeno poppers and fried pickles were edible.

There are maybe two or three places that make an acceptable product, but the vast majority are middling at best. And while I've liked the ribs at a few of my hometown BBQ joints, the ribs at Central BBQ are a revelation and worlds better than even the best I've eaten at home.If there's one thing we do well in NY, it's Buffalo style wings. Great wings are a magical fryer balancing act. The wing must be fried long enough to create a shatteringly crisp skin and to melt its fat underneath, but no so long as to dry out the meat. Great buffalo style wings have impossibly crispy skin, with tender and juicy meat. Great wings are all about texture.Great ribs are also about texture. I was blown away by the textural perfection of Central BBQ's ribs. The outer bark was crusty and pleasantly chewy. Underneath that flavorful bark was meat that was tender but still toothsome and not overcooked to the point of mushiness. The fat that surrounded the meat was rendered just until moist and creamy. Chewy/crispy bark, tender meat, creamy fat. Those three textural contrasts make for a fantastic eating experience.My sides were fine but unimpressive, and I didn't try any of the other BBQ.

It also has a ton of great places to eat. Central BBQ needs to be added to everyone's ""Memphis Bucket List!!""Due to COVID, there isn't a lot of seating, but this didn't stop them from being busy. The pick up line (To-go food) was longer than the regular line, most of the time we were there. It was clean and tidy, just not a lot of seating. There is additional seating in the back areas too. We ordered the ribs for 2 with 4 sides. Not a bad price, $27. The ribs were perfect. Not falling of the bone, but almost. This is the way they are supposed to be!!! Super tender and juicy. Nice amount of burnt ends. The sauce was great, with a small spice kick at the end. Not spicy, SUPER flavorful. Probably the best ribs I've ever had. Being from Texas (we are famous for beef ribs) we know BBQ, Central BBQ is sublime. Their pork ribs are better than anything I've had in Texas, or Memphis. The sides were good, but small portions. I'm not complaining, because the price was so good. We ordered Mac & Cheese, Beans, Collard Greens and Cole Slaw. The problem with the sides is...we wanted MORE!!! They were so good. Mac & Cheese was hot and creamy, Beans were tangy with a little bit of a sweet end, Collard Greens were good, but a little bland, needed a little bit of hot sauce, in my opinion. The Cole slaw was good with a good amount of dressing. Not soggy. Another amazing addition to this great place, the staff.Everyone was so nice and accommodating. They seem to pool their tips and share with everyone at the end of the day. Please tip generously. Everyone was working hard and earning their keep. Please go to Central BBQ. It is across from the Civil Rights Museum (a MUST see). Go over before or after your meal to tour the museum and pay homage MLK. It will not disappoint.",2,8,8,6,0

They also have their sauces, dry rib rub, and other merchandise available for purchase.My husband's chose the pulled chicken sandwich.  He wasn't too impressed with it (I think he should've gotten the pulled pork).  He didn't think it was bad...but it didn't rock his world.

The rib meat was tender and seriously cooked to perfection.  The meat alone was extremely flavorful and smoky.  My son actually ate most of it... Like I said, I should've ordered a full rack.  The slaw was tasty as well.  I wish it had more of a tangy/vinegar taste, but the crunch went really well with the meal.  Now, if you are a baked beans fan..you will LOVE their baked beans.  They had a slight kick to them that amps up the flavor.My one son ordered chicken tenders and onion rings. I didn't taste the tenders, but the onion rings were so-so.  What we loved was that they had the dry rub seasoning available on the table. We put that on EVERYTHING. They kicked up the onion rings a notch :)  They had different BBQ sauces available by the fountain drink machine: Mild, Hot, Mustard and Vinegar.  All were amazing.  My favorites were the Hot and Vinegar.I know there are different Central BBQ locations.

The macaroni was advertised as baked macaroni but came out like more of a stove top mix, however it was still very tasty. Fried Okra is my FAVORITE! I was very excited to see it offered on the menu!

DD also had an incredibly generous and crunchy Caesar salad as well as a cup of a rich, brown gumbo that was well prepared and took be back to NOLA.The entrees are very generous and worth sharing.  My butterflied trout covered an entire plate!  It was very fresh and perfectly seasoned, albeit heading to overcooked.  The green beans are the soft and stewed southern preparation, but they were very flavorful.  DH had an excellent pulled pork po'boy, which is a HUGE roll loaded down with tender pulled pork, slaw and bacon.  His collard greens were tender and perfectly seasoned.  The LOs enjoyed chicken fingers with broccoli as well as soft fish tacos (an adult dish) with broccoli.  If you are looking for a veg, get the broccoli - they are lightly steamed and topped with Parmesan cheese for a well prepared vegetable that still has a crunch.For dessert, we ordered the lemon pie and the caramel pecan pie.  The lemon pie was very key lime esque with a graham cracker crust and a mild flavored custard.  It was a very good pie, but that was largely because there were minced pecans in the graham cracker crust with cinnamon that took it to another level.  I would have eaten anything in that crust.The caramel pecan pie similarly impressed.  It was like a pecan brown sugar pie on pastry.  Actually, you didn't need the crust because the hearty filling had all that you needed - crunchy and goopy at one time.We were really pleased to find the Cooper outpost of this local restaurant.  With its three locations, I highly recommend finding one when you are in the Memphis area and checking it out.",11,116,1763,3692,1

It's amazing. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could - but not five just because the chicken comes in spicy only - although it's not entirely too spicy, some people who prefer mild won't have a choice.The chicken has a great flavor - not too bready - definitely not too greasy - and the chicken is juicy and not dry. It's HOT when it comes out - so don't burn your fingers. I am sad I didn't try the dark meat, because I love thighs.The Mac and cheese is super cheesy with orange cheese - not amazing, just cheesy. So if you like that - get the Mac and cheese.The beans were good...just not overly flavorful. I didn't try the greens, but they seemed to look great. And the fried okra was some of the best I've ever had. I couldn't tell if they were frozen for too long - sometimes you can taste that. These allowed you to taste the okra itself and not so much the breading which I liked.I wanted to love the fried green tomatoes MORE - but they were a little on the bland side and I expected more flavor from them. The breading was light and tasty but that's mostly what I tasted. They could have been a fried green cucumber and I couldn't tell the difference...so maybe if the tomatoes were thicker and more ripe they would have tasted better.The sweet tea is the sweetest tea I've ever had - it was fresh and refreshing as well - not like some that sit in that metal container and has an old taste. This was great. Cut down the sweetness with ordering 1/2 and 1/2 (1/2 regular + 1/2 sweet).I will also add the service was amazing...we put our names on the waitlist BEFORE we arrived and waited only about 10 minutes once arriving instead of the over an hour wait some people had to wait.

They're very welcoming and I only had to wait a few minutes for a table to open up. I started off with an order of their fried green tomatoes and an 8 piece fried chicken. Fried green tomatoes is a must for me now everyone I head to the south. But unfortunately, they were over cooked here. The tomatoes were very mushy and were missing that snap of freshness when you bite in to them. I was also hoping they had used the same seasoning as they do for their chicken, but instead they use a regular batter than didn't do much. Would probably still order these again though. The fried chicken was amazing. We didn't have to wait much for our food to come out and yet it still came out piping hot. The chicken was perfectly fried, and seasoned perfectly. This isn't your traditional fried chicken. Here they add some spices to it to add a kick and slightly different color. The spiciness in every bite is what makes this place special and unique.I'm glad I gave this location a chance, and will now go back to Chicago wanting to give their location a second shot.

However every thing else on the menu I ordered was pretty bad. I ordered a combination hibachi with steak and scallops and sushi. I ordered my steak mid rare and it's like the chef had a personal vendetta against my steak.  I could swear he had to microwave it, deep fry it and run it over with a semi truck to cook it that hard maybe even took it out back and beat it with a tire iron.. completely inedible.  The scallops are frozen and that's fine but that was also cooked with a vengeance and was like trying to eat a fishy piece of leather. Tempura batter on the fried roll was so watered down you can't even call it fried. More like hint of air fryer. Someone please teach your kitchen staff how to properly prepare food.

Arriving 90 minutes before my game to explore the outdoor area & the activities I read in the Memphis Flyer. It was everything described & some additional unexpected things included.The tiki bar areas' decor is Chic & provides a flat screen for sports & is decent for a view of concerts. I like the patios & open space along with the fact they are a dog friendly venue. The indoor areas' also widely spacious featuring a stage & plenty of floor space for live acts entertainment & dining. Multiple screens available to watch sports & other events. RailGartens' excellent when it comes to hosting parties & get togethers I would recommend anyone to host it at this venue.   Menu options have a reasonable selections of apps & entrees but I believe they could offer a couple more items. My favorite thing to order is their chicken tenders with fries instead of the chips. Portions are generous I found my whole meal prepped fantastically with every chicken tender golden brown juicy & moist. Their fries had the perfect amount of crispy texture & moist juicyness I come to expect from fries. Our server Alex does an excellent job attending to the players at our Sunday games here as she makes sure our orders are correct. She is one of the kindness servers you will ever meet.   I would recommend anyone coming here to enjoy themselves here to have her.

The only place you could order was from the outdoor bar, right next to the live entertainment. It was too loud to order a drink much less food. The staff wasn't terrible, however, you had to basically scream at them to tell them what you wanted to order due. There were no waiters and the tables were not cleaned and sanitized after each customer. Although the ordering experience left much to be desired, the food was the biggest disappointment. There are so many truly amazing places to eat in Memphis and I am only in town a few days a year. I love trying new places and was excited to try this place. I ordered a burger and fries and when I tell you McDonalds dollar menu, I mean it in size and taste. For the price, I would have assumed I would have gotten a pretty nice burger that didn't look like it came straight out of a drive through, but alas, here we are writing this review. This place is a disappointment and I would very much recommend you trying one of Memphis's many other wonderful establishments. Almost ANYWHERE would give you more bang for your buck.

They told us we couldn't reserve seats but their was a group of people, smaller than us, that reserved two tables and were extremely rude saying that they need an extra table to put the food they can't finish on. It was insane. On that table it was just one bag and purse. After that, we found one table, but we barely fit, meanwhile groups of 4 people took tables meant for 10+ which was an awful look that they couldn't move these small groups of people to smaller tables.

There are near endless toppings, so the indecisive may want to go with one of the specialty creations.I always say that I'm going to order the ""slim"" size (10""), but I'm always glad when I order the ""Husky"" size (16""). The crust is super thin, so the pizzas aren't overwhelmingly filling, at least not from the dough.Since I had plenty of crust real estate to work with, I asked for red sauce on one side and white sauce on the other. It's like two pizzas in one! I topped my pizza with a variety of veggies including tomatoes, onions, red peppers and artichokes. The shredded mozzarella is delicious, hitting all the right cheesy notes. Every employee I interacted with was incredibly friendly and helpful.

I've dined at the location in Nashville; therefore, I'm familiar with the brand. Also the fact S&H has a fully operational location, opening a 2nd one should be a breeze.1st. There was a line to get in, understood, it's COVID. I'll stand in line it wasn't that bad.2nd. The workers are  wearing mask that don't fit their face, so what's the point. ‍ They pull the mask down to ask questions, so again why wear the mask as you talk over my food you are preparing. ‍ Get a mask that FITS!! That means it COVERS your ""mouth AND your nose"". PERIOD!!!3rd. Turn the damn music down and perhaps you CAN HEAR ME!!!4th. How about this novel idea amid COVID, have a pizza ordering sheet that customers complete to AVOID customers having to pull down their mask to talk to employees who don't know how to wear mask. Defeats the purpose.5th. Hire a security guard who knows how to direct traffic. There were cars double parked and blocking cars in a ""actual"" parking spot.6th. The online ordering system needs some adjustments, it was saying 2-3 hour wait for pickup but of course standing in line was much quicker, maybe 45 minutes to and hour.To my point, hopefully management will get it together and make a few changes for a smoother operation. Now on to the food, is it good, YES, ABSOLUTELY!!!  Plentiful, meh..is it shareable? If your two skinny girls with no appetite, lol. We ordered the HUSKY P.R.E.A.M. let's just say I wish I had ordered my own HUSKY not to share. ‍The sauces are really good too. My favorites are the Balsamic and Garlic Garlic Butter neither are as strong as you'd think, but a great twist to add to your pizza for taste.Will I return, sure.

All I can say is OMG! This place was magnificent. There have been so many places around town that have opened locally in the last 8 years with the claims to be as good as New Orleans. Well they have all been a huge disappointment until now. Let me tell you son, Parish Grocery is the real deal. My family had everything from the Shrimp Po' Boy to the Abita Ham and Swiss Cheese Po' Boy. We also had the fried pickles for our appetizer, three of the sides (which were ALL flavorful and delicious), and their bread pudding and banana pudding for dessert. Those two desserts are some of the best I've ever had. Restaurant was clean, followed all the current protocols regarding this pandemic we're in, and the staff could not have been any nicer than they were to us. Found out they have been around since April '20 in this location. So glad they have made it through these difficult times and I hope they are around for decades to come. The best part about Parish Grocery is my family doesn't have to go to New Orleans anymore for the real deal. Other places around town just come in ""Second"" if you know what I mean.

I reach in my mouth and end up pulling a FOOT LONG DARK HAIR out!!!  I entirely lost my appetite after that and made myself seriously question the cleanliness standards of this restaurant, as the first rule of cooking in one is to wear a hair net or make sure hair doesn't fall into the food. If that's not bad enough, I talk to the same guy on the phone calmly and politely saying how I found a FOOT LONG HAIR in my food, he tells me I would have to talk to his boss since he isn't authorized to give me a refund, and ""she's really busy.""  After extensively explaining how disgusting it was to find a hair like that in my mouth while eating their food (as if it weren't obvious enough), he puts me on hold for 5 minutes, and upon return I don't even get to speak to the manager or boss. He asks me if I saved my receipt and once I find it claims to have voided the order, and if it still shows up on my bank or credit statement, contact my card company. This was just all around a terrible experience that no one should go through. Good luck to all others who dare eat at this place!",2,0,1,2,0

I prefer tables with chairs so I sat in the lean to addition. The room was nice and had some great artwork in it. The shoddy ductwork really takes away from the appearance. Also the waitress was sweeping at eleven (I was her first customer) and I asked if the night crew didn't clean yet. She told me the lighting is inadequate for cleaning at night. Ok. I'm not sure how many roaches and rodents they have, but this would be ideal for them. So I ordered the dish with raw tuna, and it was not only delicious, but the appearance was expertly crafted and designed. There were samplings of different vegetables and the fish was of utmost quality and taste. She was also very generous on the portion of fish, considering what you receive for the price of sashimi at other places. The dish, however, was not enough to fulfill me. Now normally, when I spend $10 on lunch, finish it, and still want more I feel cheated, especially if there is a similar food around town that is a better value. That wasn't the case here though. Considering the cost and price of sushi and sashimi elsewhere,I felt this was a bargain. What I ordered next was a tilapia appetizer that looked like a salmon patty. Patties are usually mixed up fish, while these were whole pieces that had vegetables and jalapenos mixed into the breading.I thought it was brilliant.The waitress ( young black lady) was a great example of everything a waitress should be. I wish she was at every restaurant I eat at. She gave me a warm welcome, was polite, but not intrusive, and more than willing to help. She seemed to really enjoy serving me. Way to go!I really like the simplicity of your menu, and the pictures were a great aid in helping to make an ordering decision. You realize that most of your customers are not as familiar as you are with your food. I found the whole experience to be easy. I also loved the amount of heat that was applied to the dishes. It may be too much for some, but I love it. The silverware chop sticks really add another element to the experience. I remember all the restaurants in Seoul having these. It makes the wooden ones seem so cheap.So far you have five stars. It was when I went to pay and thank the cook that I noticed that the ceiling, the ductwork, and the exhaust hood were not only dirty, but literally have large pieces of dirt hanging down. There is paint peeling and falling off the ductwork. The exhaust hood is painted and should be stainless steel to clean properly. I deduct one star for this and your inability to provide enough light to clean at closing. Inexcusable. I wanted to take pictures if this, but wasn't able to without drawing attention.8/23/16.

I definitely got my money's worth and I got to really enjoy some food for once, rather than simply satisfying a hunger. I ordered the Ojingkuh Bokeum which means stir fried squid. I have no idea how you say it and I had to take a picture of the menu to know how to spell it, but I figured out real fast how to eat it. Each and every bite was absolutely delicious. They weren't that busy and after my meal, I walked over to the open door of the kitchen. There were two chefs back there. I shook both their hands. I really respect people like this. Not only are they hard working, they aspire to learn and become better at what they do. This is not food that you can do yourself at home. This takes knowing culture, tradition, and cuisine, and you have to have a passion for your craft. I could taste that in every bite. It really was that good! I ordered that stir fried squid dish as hot as they could possibly make it and then I said put peppers in it. I ain't gonna lie. That shit was hot, but it was wonderful! I got more than my fair share of squid. In fact, they were more than generous. But that sauce they cooked it in must have taken years of experience. It was wonderful in every respect and I sopped it up with the rice. It was bursting with flavor and I can't wait to eat it again! I spent 2 weeks in Korea in 99 on a tour playing music to entertain American troops who sacrificed time away from their families to protect our liberties. They are also there to protect the South from communism above the 38th parallel. I fell in love with Korean food and culture. I loved everything about this restaurant and it brought back some memories. The water here was a hell of a lot better, but I remember their beer being better. Why won't America allow us to have genuine imported beer that isn't actually made domestically? I'll be back. I really was impressed. One thing though, I do remember gas grills in the tables in Korea, but not electric. Is this a new thing or is it some kind of stringent American safety code?

The staff is super friendly and the place is well open and spacious with tvs.We quickly ordered 2 dishes Kalbi and Dukbokki but realized we wanted to try the Kimbop and that as well. Food was served pretty quickly and I liked all 3 dishes. The portions are not huge but good for 2 ppl. Probably would stick with beef Kimbop next time.The only thing I see diff from any other ordinary korean restaurant is that there is no side dishes that come with your entrees. They charge you .50 each for it if you want. I'm already paying  $23 for my kalbi order I think I deserve some side dishes. Since it was late I didn't even bother to look at their alcohol selections.

My only beef is the chairs are uncomfortable.Service was knowledgeable and attentive. Our waitress spent a few minutes talking to us about Guonjang - the spicy ketchup like condiment that we both love. She found out that DWJ2's is made in house.We split a half order of the vegetarian dumplings and the seafood and kimchee pancake. The same dipping sauce comes with both. The dumplings were a little doughy though delicious. The minced tofu filling was nicely flavored. The pancake was crispy and tasted more of the kimchee than the seafood. The only seafood we saw were a couple pieces of squid. For our main course, my friend order the spicy pork bulgogi. I got the spicy chicken bulgogi. Both of us were very happy with our selections. Spicy in Korean seems to mean flavorful, not hot. One quibble was forks didn't seem to be available. I do okay with chopsticks eating certain things. Messy Molly likes to appear when things are bigger than bite sized, so I opted to make them finger food.Beer list is pretty limited. They have a couple on draft.

The cook that day also gave me funny looks after I asked the question and continued to do this until I switched seats with my partner. We decided to order the Bibimbap and was told that white rice was our only option. Having also made this before this is not true either but I suppose this location does not cater to the health conscious. The Bibimbap was very dry and the entire bowl was mostly rice.

Think vodka but with a sweet taste. Typically you drink this as a shot while eating your meal or mixed together with your beer. I find it a 60-40, soju being the latter to be a good ratio. Preferably mixed with a Korean brand beer.For those unsure where this location is, DWJ 2 is the new home of the former Green Cork.Now onto the review.During my visit, they didn't have the liquor license to serve soju as of yet but I am told that it is coming soon! So look forward to this delight! They have been open for about a week now and still a hidden gem. Their menu is smaller compared to their sister store, on Hacks Cross near the Buffalo Wild Wings, but they serve all the essential dishes for a good old Korean barbecue. When they bring you a small menu of the side dishes they offer, you must get the potato salad it's just to die for! My friend and I decided to cook our own meat or you can have the kitchen cook for you and have it served ready to eat. I recommend ordering the kimchi seafood pancake (haemulpajeon), I'd you're not sure about the kimchi you can order one without, it's an egg pancake with an assortment of seafood which is very good. Followed by the main course the galbi  and bulgogi. The forerunners of any Korean barbecue. The meats had a very nice marinate and we're just delicious after grilled on the table side cook top. We washed everything down with a PBR and a draft Stella Artois.If you like your food spicy as much as I do then ask for some gochujang you won't be disappointed.

It was hard to shake the oil. The sauce on the bass was tasty. The portion was small, hard to determine size but we guess under 4oz. We peaked at another table's coming out, it seemed larger. The roasted salmon was cooked in a similar fashion. It was hard to taste the salmon from the oil. The polenta was tasty, the green beans were cooked well. The red sauce we did not like, it was lacking flavor and a bit sweet. The fish tacos (2) were good but not worth $24.

It was quite good but never got refilled and we were kind of confused by the concept? Anyways, our food comes out and both of us were underwhelmed.

Barramundi is a flake-y white fish, with a distinctly gentle taste, native to Australia and I lived in Oz for a number of years, so was excited about getting to eat Barramundi again.My one tip would be to make a booking, as this place got busy fast, and also pray to the parking gods as their side parking lot was full (and it's not massively big to begin with)! Anyway, since it was a work dinner, I didn't want to drink and got a virgin pomegranate cocktail ($4). It was just chockablock with ice, so the juice taste was really diluted albeit the fresh mint leaves were a drink-saver. Also, no sweet tea, instead you get regular tea and the sugar packets to sweeten the drink to your taste.We split one plate of Asian nachos ($12) as our starter. You could totally tell the crispy nachos were homemade and the tuna on top was EXCELLENT! The siracha and white sauce (not sure what this was) plus jalapeno all served to make this dish a great palate pleaser. For the mains, I got the Barramundi small plate ($20) and at my first bite, it took me right back to being back in Sydney, eating fish and chips by the beach, although this barramundi was a much fancier version of the humble fish n chips. It was pretty good and I loved the combination of corn it was served with. This dish also had a lovely spicy, tangy sauce and I wish there had been more of this on my plate!I also tried the spicy shrimp pasta from a co-diner. Loved the heat and seafood was perfectly cooked, but it didn't beat my Barramundi!Also, make sure you save room for dessert! Based on previous Yelp reviews, I went with Ginger donuts with coconut sorbet ($8). Despite best efforts, I couldn't finish and took one donut home to eat the next day, and 2 days later, the donut was still as good as when served piping hot to the table! I had a taste of the Chocolate stout cake ($8) too, but this was too stout-y tasting for me and I prefer to drink my Guinness, not mix it in cake.We had a really lovely time, even if the neighbourhood to get here was a little bit dodgy!

If you love eggs and if you like deviled eggs, you will appreciate this cool spin on a traditional deviled egg. The wasabi isn't overpowering or too spicy, but definitely adds a level of flavor to the dish.For the entrée I enjoyed the fish tacos. I loved the flavor in the spicy lemongrass slaw. It was delicious. The aioli put this dish over the top. My mentor is gluten free and enjoyed the spice crusted tuna on cucumber salad with wasabi vinaigrette. She orders this every single time and per usual Tsunami delivered an amazing dish.The wait staff was extremely attentive. Our waitress also recommended the fish tacos, so she gets extra brownie points. The establishment has some parking, but it is extremely limited. Street parking is going to be your best option.

Let's just say that my husband smelled it before it got to the table and it could have actually been that it had turned.  You know how meat changes color when it's gone too far?  Well it's possible that it was cooked perfectly, but was grey and didn't smell right.  My husband who never sends food back, did.  It didn't help that the puree underneath was also cold.To Tsunami's credit, however, the duck that was delivered to a table next to us looked lovely.  So I don't know.  Did it look like we were bad tippers?  Like we were going to use a coupon on something?  Maybe it's just because it was a Monday and they were burning up stock? .... I don't know.  But what we got had little love.  Little care.  And it made a couple of new parents who simply can't get out much very sad.I can't say that we wouldn't go back and try again.  But it's not likely with all the other places happening.  But if you have the time, go and try and see what you think.  Maybe ours was a fluke.",0,3,14,1,0

It all depends on what you are after. This advice is being given on the thought of two people sharing a meal. They offer tapas, therefore make this a tapas meal worth sharing. IF you are feeling more adventurous, get 3 tapas sans one of the main entrees and go with the bottle of wine anyway. The meal and the ambiance are mood perfect for wine. Plus service has always been more than stellar when I've gone.Last piece of advice, leave the kids at home so you don't spoil it for the rest of the patrons. This isn't a kid place.

My husband and manager went with the steak of the evening and were very pleased with their selection. I opted for the scallops. They were actually quite delicious. I was not a fan of the broccoli rabe as my side and I was completely overwhelmed at the prospect of an entire menu dedicated to cheese. It was a very nice choice, but not a typical selection for me.

They were served on a plate with nothing else, just tempura and squash blossom. The batter was too thick which resulted in uncooked batter on the inside. The only flavor was tempura and salt. The burratta tasted like it was made with sour milk, had a very off-putting flavor. The carbonara tasted ok but was dry. It looked as if it had very little egg in it. The sardines were burnt. The sardines were left on the grill/in the pan too long and they burnt badly. The fish tasted like charcoal. The rapini has sliced garlic in it that was also badly burnt.

It forms the high heel on the ""boot"" of Italy. Bari Ristorante is a perfect representation of Puglia. Every plate, every morsel is a trip to a region of Italy that is overlooked and under appreciated. Puglia's cucina povera (peasant cooking) is legendary. Olive oil, grapes, tomatoes, eggplants, artichokes, peppers, salami, mushrooms, olives and fresh seafood are the regional staples.Yes, I love Puglia. As a young American, I was fortunate to grow up there. While it has some of Italy's best food and wine, it's rare to hear a foreign voice in Apulia.Puglia is sun-bleached landscapes, olive groves, picturesque seascapes and memorable coastal towns. It's a lush, largely flat farming region, with a long coast that alternates between limestone precipices and long sandy beaches. And props to Bari's intimate bar. In a city riddled with substandard ""bartenders"", Brad Pitts (yes, that's right) is an exceptional mixologist that demonstrates the art, craft and mastery of making cocktails. Memphis is fortunate to have this stellar example of Italian cuisine. Bella!FYI...if you're looking for red/meat sauces, unlimited breadsticks and fried mozzarella, this is not your venue.

After seeing all the four and five-star reviews from my fellow Yelpers my wife and I decided to give Bari Restaurant a second go. The service was very good and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and had some very good recommendations. I didn't take a look at the wine menu but from reading some of the previous reviews my understanding is that they generally serve mostly Italian wines. My wife prefers a good Chardonnay and I prefer a good Sauvignon Blanc. I was very surprised that the restaurant carried only one Chardonnay so my wife ordered that Chardonnay and I ordered a Sauvignon Blanc recommended by our waiter. If a restaurant carries only one Chardonnay you would think that they would choose a halfway decent Chardonnay. Unfortunately, the Chardonnay my wife received was the worst we have ever had and tasted like it was watered down. I'm sure their Italian wines are quite good, so enough about the wine, let's move on to our meal choices. We started off with theCalamari Con Pomodoro:sautéed calamari with tomatoes, garlic and black olives. This plate was beautifully presented, nice flavors, slightly on the fishy side but overall a very good choice for calamari fans. Next we ordered a cheese plate which we left up to our waiter to put together for us. They have an extensive cheese menu and the selections made by our waiter were right on point. My only critique is that they served the cheese without any crackers or bread. They do occasionally come around and put one thin slice of bread on your plate but I would have preferred a basket of bread or crackers served with what turned out to be a very expensive cheese plate. For our main entrées, I ordered the Rigatoni Con Funghi, Broccoli E Formaggio Di Capra: Rigatoni with portabella, broccoli, garlic, and goat cheese. My wife ordered a Halibut special which was actually very good and nicely presented. Overall, my rigatoni was very good; presentation was beautifully done but portion size was disappointing. We finished our meal ordering one dessert, two cappuccinos and shared the Torte Di Gelato Di Banana:Home made torte filled with banana mascarpone zabaglione gelato, served with chocolate drizzle (suggested with sforno puglia moscato). Overall, the food seems to be pretty good but not great. Portions are on the small size and the food tends to be overpriced.

Its actually a lot smaller than I expected. Not much room inside, just a table and an ice cream cooler.  They definitely could put some decor inside to make it a little more inviting and fun. To match their pretty food!I went close to dinner, around 7, and it was relatively busy. I had to wait outside until a group of girls were done ordering, but it wasn't long. I decided to try one of their already created picks. I got the ""take me back to cali"" waffle cream. When I said that at the check out she asked if I wanted to substitute the ice cream flavor, and I jumped on that offer! It's nice you can pick a pre-made option but also tweak it a bit.The waffle cream was delicious! It was cinnamon sugar waffle, with oreo ice cream, Carmel drizzle, and cinnamon toast crunch on top. What a delicious combo! I would definitely get it again.

I ordered a scoop of the Krazy Kolors flavor, which at first glance I assumed was blueberry-flavored. Oh no, this is a wonderful blue-dyed creamy vanilla with chunks of Oreo AND cookie dough. Why isn't this a flavor at every ice cream parlor? It was so, so delicious.The employees were very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.

The first time I visited I fell in love with this place! We were welcomed by the staff, asked if we needed help with the menu and so on. This time we walk in, there's one girl behind the register, no greeting just a blank stare. My niece asked if she was able to sample some ice cream and got a response of no ma'am! Which is fine if that's the policy because of COVID! But the way it was said was quite rude! Then my sister asked about the black walnut ice cream, what type of flavor it was.. the cashiers response was read the description! The description said black walnut! Lol! I got the peaches and cream, which according to the menu said peach flavored waffle, vanilla ice cream and fresh peaches! The peaches were diced and looked and tasted like peaches from a dole fruit cup! Not at all what I imagined it would look like. And last but not least my niece received her ice cream in a cup and asked for a top since it was raining.. the cashiers response, no ma'am! I don't know if this girl was having a bad day or what but it was a very bad experience. It was my niece and sisters first time so I'm sure they won't be returning. I spoke very highly of this place which is why they wanted to try it out! Luckily I had a good first experience from the first time I went. Maybe I'll try again when it get warmer outside, hopefully the pleasant staff will be there that day. After that experience I honestly didn't even want the ice cream!",2,11,52,121,1

This place had been on my list for a minute, but I randomly chose it one night when surprising my boyfriend with a date night. Easily one of our favorite spots we've been to. I love the environment here, the windows are huge and so you get a lot of natural lighting. The colors are beautiful and reflect that natural light perfectly! Even the colors of the servers' uniforms all went together, even though they were all wearing something different. This place was intentional with their color scheme. Our server was great, she was super cool, but at the same time had amazing knowledge over the menu. You can tell they take a lot of time training their servers to ensure they can answer every question that is asked. Because wow, we had a lot of questions over that menu. She did great and offered awesome recommendations! It was overall a fancy experience with her, they have very traditional etiquette when serving their guests (replacing plates and utensils and wiping off the area in front of the guests before the next plate is brought, and so on). The food was superb. We got the Sourdough appetizer and it was perfectly smoky! I truly wish I could tell you about everything on the pasta list, but I know maybe 10% of the ingredients that were listed? That being said, I got the Gnudi because our server recommended it. She did not steer me wrong! It was amazing and I appreciated that she knew what was good on the menu. For dessert, we got the Rice Pudding and the Cannoli. I would skip the cannoli next time, but that rice pudding was unlike any other. What a unique dessert addition! I see why they added it though, it was amazing and had the perfect amount of cinnamon. We had putt putt at the Orpheum afterwards. If you are wanting a dream date night, go to Catherine and Mary's for dinner and then to see a play at the Orpheum (post-COVID) after, as it is a ONE minute walk away! ALSO, their power went out halfway through our dinner. They accommodated immediately and it didn't seem to affect the experience at all. They lit candles and brought out a speaker. Very impressive.

The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and our server Becca was very kind and helpful in identifying what would be best for the vegetarians at the table. The sommelier Chris also did a great job picking a bottle everyone at the table enjoyed. The food however, didn't blow me away like I wanted it to. We ordered the 3-piece cheese plate and mozzarella to start. The mozz was delicious, but the 3-piece cheese plate was underwhelming for the $17 it cost. Maybe it was the way they plated it, but I just wasn't impressed.My fiancé and I ordered the two vegetarian pasta dishes: cacio e pepe and I don't remember the name of his. They were decent. I think the cacio e pepe flavor popped a little too much, though it didn't stop me from eating it all.We shared canolis for dessert. They weren't very sweet and they had bits of orange. It's not my favorite kind of canoli but it wasn't bad.I think because it's pricey, I had seriously high expectations for Catherine & Mary's.

It's fine dining for sure, in a large open space with a sort of deconstructed ceiling and columns which create a cool open atmosphere.Everyone was dressed much nicer than us. We just come from a full day of touring around town and were too hungry to go back to hotel to change. We walked in and said ""Hi we don't have a reservation, are under dressed for this place, and we're starving."" They quickly responded ""We don't have a dress code and are happy to see you."" They seated us right away on a night that was already super crowded...made us feel quite welcome.We started with the impressive Pickle Plate which included watermelon, celery, pickles, onions, pickles, apricots, pickle, cauliflower and green beans. Everything was pickled! I really enjoyed the pickled pickles, and the pickled watermelon were very unique! My wife's favorite was the pickled cauliflower which was prepared with yellow curry.We also shared a brussels sprouts side. They had good, perfectly cooked texture with some lovely crispy fried bits as well. As served, this was definitely saltier than it needed to be. We have the cheese sauce served on the side to accommodate a non-dairy eater in our party, and when the brussels were mixed with the cheese sauce, it definitely helped temper the salt a bit.I had Francobelli Pasta (postage stamp shaped and sized ravioli) stuffed with all kinds of fresh vegetables and served with leeks and other items. This was very fresh tasting and the plate size was plenty for me as a main couple with the the other dishes we had ordered.  The lemon flavor was the most prominent in the dish.This was a lovely last meal in Memphis and a great and comfortable fine-dining spot and atmosphere.",3,943,318,986,1

I didn't say anything so we waited...she then brought waters and sat them down and walked back to the opposite end of the bar. Now I'm getting a little perturb as she is interacting with other guests. I immediately pull out my phone and commenced to writing a 1 - star review solely based on service. Bc the food is amazing. But as with anything you never respond when you're upset. Which is why this review is being wrote on today, Thursday, September 27th. But William completely turned the service level up...I'm not sure if he picked up on our vibes that we were a little less than happy. But his service was impeccable...we got a full debrief on the oysters ; his background ; and why he loves what he does. Every patron that sat there he was able to engage in conversation. (Mind you we still have not placed our drink orders or food orders) However, we eventually did get oysters ordered and I got the Prime Burger. This is a great place for food, wine and drinks. Great selection of oysters as well.If you took the time to read this review please visit William at 117 Prime and feel free to tell him I sent you! This young man should know how amazing he is and how awesome of a job he does !",2,198,6,4,0

No worries...we called and they saved our information.Mind you, it was about 20 degrees that evening and our reservation was later, so we ready beyond ready to wine and dine. We got there about 10 mins early, and they said they were unsure if they could seat us, but then found a table...OUTSIDE.Okay, it was a patio and had heaters BUT no ma'am. Not 20 degrees with people in and out bringing in ALL the cold air. The hostess said, ""well, when you make your reservation online it automatically seats you wherever so that's why..."" blah blah. I corrected her in saying, ""ummm no ma'am, I called"". Then she gave me some other excuse. I said, no thanks...we will wait at the bar until a table becomes available. We ordered a few drinks, uncomfortably watching other couples being seated on the enclosed patio  but they were shivering and uncomfortable. We get our drinks and then we are seated. Before this, they guy from the bar said please settle up before moving because it makes it harder (ok...weird as this place isn't that big, but whatever). My husband tells the hostess he wants to pay and the other gentleman in the front says, don't worry you can put it in your meal tab. Ummmm okWe sit down, and I take a sip of my drink and my throughly is aflame! The drink was not mixed and tasted like a straight shot of whiskey. Bottom shelf and not what I ordered... Our waitress mentioned that the ice just needed to melt a little bit, but ma'am...there was never ice in here AND in fact my drink is room temp sooooo I asked for something different because it totally ruined my taste for something special. I've tasted quite a few things and been to tasting parties, so I knew that drink couldn't have been exactly right. But whatever...lemme just order. I get the 10oz sirloin. It was tasty (once I added the bernaise sauce, but tbh I would have much preferred a steak I made at home or Houston's or Even Logan's. I had just as much bone (to add weight I see) as I did meat. To add, the spinach tasted like day old grass and my husband had to ask about having bread served.Finally, I told myself to just end without dinner, but I wanted to give one more try. Well, I should have listened to my first mind. The custard for the key lime pie was decent, but the crust...idk I was anticipating a standard graham cracker crust, but no. It tasted more like a flour crust for a tarte or something. Should've gotten the creme brûlée' instead. Problem is, there won't be a next time for us. We wanted to venture out and try something different. This just wasn't it. Quite possibly, this was a fluke. And while I'm no chef or bartender, anyone that's had my food and fanfare know I'm well learned in the kitchen so my tastebuds are quite knowledgeable! Gave it a good go, and we spent quite a bit there...I actually didn't care for the wine, but sucked it up like a champ in effort to be cordial and sweet to my waitress as that was her suggestion. Too many excuses during the service and the food was not worth the money. I get their staff is younger and it's a newer restaurant, but I'll pass.  I want to give 2 stars, but I didn't see the restroom and didn't get sick, which is why I'm being a little generous. Stick to what you know is my suggestion.",0,670,34,5,0

There were only 5 of them per order. I was expecting a dozen. . My husband and I shared a 16oz Ribeye, loaded baked potato and a side of grilled asparagus.  We still came home with a doggy bag. Everything is a la carte.  The sides are very generous. Our son got the catch of the day which was Red Snapper- which was served with sides.  He had no complaints with his dinner. The steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The baked potato was huge but a tad undercooked.  The asparagus was probably the best I've ever had.  The other tables had yummy looking rolls but we weren't offered any.  My husband had a premium bourbon.  I just had water. I'm not sure if the glass had an odor or the water just tasted bad.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  The manager came by our table to check on our dinner.  When I mentioned this was our first visit, he offered us a free dessert.   He and the server both suggested the rhubarb/strawberry pie. I was skeptical but we felt adventurous.   They baked it fresh after it was ordered.  It took 10-15 min to come out but was definitely worth the wait.  The serving was plenty for each of the 3 of us to have a decent sized serving.  It was also served with a creamy, premium vanilla ice cream.  We were all very pleasantly surprised on how great it tasted. The manager came back to Our table to see if we enjoyed the pie.  The meal was pricey but was a great splurge for a special occasion.  They partner with the Orpheum with special menu and pricing on show nights for season ticket holders.  We will definitely come back.  There was a very cool looking bar in the rear of the restaurant.  There were comfy chairs, love seats and sofas to relax.  It looked like a great place to hang out with friends. There was a smaller bar in the front as well. . The restrooms were clean and well stocked.  There was a comfy chair in the ladies room which would be great for a nursing mom.",8,27,134,412,1

I almost told him to forget about it. He said he would go see in the back if they were able to make the Vietnamese Iced Coffee and I told him really if you don't have it it's no problem I can come back another time. Knowing that another time would probably 6 months or a year or six years or whatever.Turned out that he did have the stuff in the back and it took about 5 minutes for the coffee to come out but I'll tell you what. When it came out it was really worth the wait! That's why they're getting 5 stars.It was different to any Vietnamese iced coffee I've ever had - it was a little more creamy and English tasting and yet it was also one of the best Vietnamese iced coffees I've ever had. It pissed all over a lot of crap and mediocre ones I've been having recently, from a great height. So I gave him a tip. But not just the tip.Good place and has some cute hipsters in here too.

You just have to try lemongrass tofu with a side of both peanut sauce and curry sauce plus the red sauce in the bottle that is on the table. Get a small sweet and sour soup and add rice into it to make it like a gumbo.Workers- they are a family restaurant and the family is adorable and precious to the hearts of Memphis eaters. They are so kind and work with their customers so that the meal matches what they need. I have a four year old daughter and they are kind to her and help us order food that she will eat, and it is always so delicious it also becomes the adults at the table's meal, too.Buffet- Dude.

If you can impress me this much with a burger, I'll pay for it! $25 with tip. Anyway, I guess they gotta pay rent and labor too. And this is on the square. I loved the building too, but I'm still thinking about that burger. Sometimes I like a bit of seasoning on my meat if it isn't salty. This burger had no seasoning. It didn't need any and the cook knew that. If you're using good meat and you cook it right, you'll have the right flavor. There's no need to mask the flavor unless there's something wrong with it. You don't want to ruin good meat! The bun held up until the bitter end, even though the burger was juicy enough. Notice they toast the bun too. They gave extra on the condiments too.

I particularly enjoy the Shrimp and Grits, and while the pizzas are quite small to me, they are yummy. I had the Voodoo Pasta this last time, and it was a good choice as well. (However, what's up with covering your ketchup bottles with plastic wrap and not a cap - huh?)Most of my issues have to do with the service. This most recent experience included a non-responsive waitress who expected us to read her mind, got pissy when we asked for things as simple as more napkins, and did not appreciate us asking about the the wrong (or at least incorrectly cooked) burger she delivered to the table. Oh, I'm sorry, let me go to the kitchen for you. Her attitude was unnecessary, especially when we were very polite and unassuming.And if there's one thing that will convince me to not return, it's attitude. Thankfully, I'm aware of the Bosco's I once knew and may return in hopes of an experience like it used to be.

They have slushees such as mint lemonade. What was unique to me was their rice bowls and hummus bowls. We ordered the falafel hummus bowl, gyro salad, gyro rice bowl, gyro pita, and mint lemonade. The inside has mostly tables for 2 so we sat outside. Thankfully there was some breeze unlike all the other scorching Memphis summer/fall days. Lots of delicious and colorful food was brought out to us. Everyone was quite pleased and satisfied with their meal choices.

Happy Greek offers sandwiches, rice and hummus bowls, salads (all vegetarian options) and delicious sides! I was surprised at the cost of this place, as you should be spending $8-$11 with a regular menu item! Pretty cost efficient considering I hardly finished my bowl. What I ordered: Regular Chicken Shawarma Rice Bowl (assembled traditionally) with baklava for dessert. ----Everything was absolutely delicious with my favorite part being the pickles I added to my bowl (not that big of a deal but just tastes like back home).Aside from food tasting great I really do believe professionalism and customer service help hold the restaurant in place. Happy Greek is right by the University of Memphis campus, and hungry/stressed college students can be hectic to any restaurant environment.

The hostess led us to a table towards the back next to the bar room where a duo were performing live blues music.We had a great waitress, very patient and attentive to our table. We ordered a full rack of Beale Street's legendary Bbq ribs! We chose steak fries with it and also came with a piece of Texas toast. The food was prepared well with the ribs literally falling off the bone. Tasty and delicious... and juicy! Hubby couldn't get enough of it. The atmosphere was lovely with a unique ambiance as we enjoyed the blues music playing in the bar room. If we were to return in Memphis again we would definitely go back and eat here.

I normally go to another Greek restaurant in town, but it was closed so decided to try this. I ordered a Greek salad and added beef & lamb. Who can mess up a Greek salad right? Apparently they can. The salad was disgusting; I could barely swallow the first bite. It's like they just threw everything together with no thought. They added a ton of dressing in the salad (I'm not sure what type of dressing it was but it wasn't the typical vinaigrette) but then also gave you additional dressing on the side. A very mushy experience. The added meat didn't help the salad either; it just made it taste worse. This salad cost $16, which is very expensive for the poor quality I received. I would not go back.",5,309,705,849,1

We were in town for a quick overnighter and stumbled upon this place on Yelp. We are big fans of Mediterranean food and were eager to try a new place out.Sitting on their outdoor patio during golden hour was the best way to start our dinner. We really love dining outside when we can. Their indoor seating was charming and well decorated too. To start, their ""Best Tea in Memphis"" is really just that. I have never had such flavorful black tea besides chai. The ginger, sage, mint and honey was the most amazing combination I've ever had. It's tastier than southern sweet tea! Enjoy it hot or iced.For our meal we shared the ""Sultan Mezza Combo"" because we enjoy sampling many items. It was generous for two people, and would no doubt get you full. It came with hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, grape leaves, tabbouleh and pita. We also each added a cup of ""Moroccan Soup."" I'm really impressed with their array of menu choices. All kinds of meat served like lamb, chicken, fish, beef, and decent vegetarian options as well. We treated ourself to homemade chocolate mousse for dessert and it was rich decadent goodness.

We sampled two advertisers: the ""Kibbeh"" and ""Simple Favorite"". The former was quite tasty, however given you only receive 3 for $7 (at time of writing) I can't say it was a high value pursuit. The latter on the other hand was fantastic, as they provided some very tasty pita bread as well as a masterfully flavorful spicy feta dip. Well worth trying out this one.I had eyed the ""Shawarma Platter"" ever since first looking the place up, so I already knew I was going to get this. Thankfully, it ended up being a great decision. The quality of the beef and lamb on my plate was astounding, and whatever marinade they had used to enrich the taste of the dish was truly what made it pop. The rice itself was good, as were the vegetables, though I did have a bit of a complaint that neither weren't very warm. Fortunately, the meat was, so I didn't bother sending it back. All things considered, it ended up being a very filling and enjoyable meal, which is particularly nice given it was one of the lower priced items on the list of entrees.I should also take the time to mention their hot tea, which is something they advertise as the ""Best in Memphis"". They may very well be correct. It is an unbelievably flavorful concoction rich in ginger, sage, and honey. I would be surprised if I hadn't drank a full pot of it by the end of dinner. Even if you're one who might prefer an iced tea (trust me, I understand that) you wont find yourself disappointed giving their hot brew a try.The service was quite great, I would say, though there weren't very many people there to begin with. The decor and atmosphere is pleasant, quite themed to the Middle East. Many ethnic establishments tend to go for more of a sterile decor, but I'm glad that wasn't the case here. There was also plenty use of candles, which further helped improve the very ""warm"" lighting utilized by the restaurant.If you're in the market for a comfortable Mediterranean dining experience, it is well worth your time and money to give this place a shot. Certainly one of the better locations to eat in the Midtown area.",0,0,29,12,0

This is a hidden gem in the Binghamton area. You really have to know it's there to see it. But once you do!!! Inspire is a quaint little spot offering coffee and coffee drinks, all day breakfast, salads, quesadillas, rice or quinoa bowls, smoothies and ice cream. The menu is written on the wall and they have printed ones. The lady behind the counter was very explanatory and very patient as I asked questions. I settled on the Southwest BBQ chicken salad. It came with romaine, black beans, corn, tomatoes, onions, cheese blend and this DELICIOUS BBQ CHICKEN! The dressing was sriracha lime ranch. This salad was sooooo good! I ate every morsel. Do yourself a favor and get over there today and try something. I will be going back soon. PS, it is small inside but I didn't have any trouble getting a seat at lunchtime.",4,110,258,943,1

It tasted good, but wasn't overly impressive. We also ordered avocado toast, which my wife and I both really liked, value and taste-wise. I also ordered a salted caramel latte, which was just slightly overly sweet, and moderately overly hot, but overall good for not a dedicated coffee shop.  Oh, and next time, I'm opting for the pancakes, because they looked absolutely delicious!They were quite busy as they had just recently opened, and I'm glad they are getting a good amount of support.

The addition of Tajin they sprinkle on top was the star. The locally baked brioche they use was light, flavorful ...just good all around. I also tried their special Brown Sugar Cinnamon Latte.

I was the ONLY customer there and chose to sit outside since it was a pretty and cool day.

I will say $15 is a bit much to pay for 2 pieces of fried chicken but I let it slide off the fact that the batter was so good and crispy. I had a wonderful server name Amber who let me try some other pastries on the menu since I'm not a sticky bun fan. I haven't anything bad here yet. I was the only person in the dining room. Came in right after brunch hours was over (my mistake) on a late Sunday afternoon. I realized I haven't been to SOB since Covid began so their menu has changed. I was informed the East Menu was different from the Downtown menu but they aren't. I decided on my tried and true General Tso Cauliflower and the Fried Chicken bao buns.

As a vegan, I'm always looking for new places to eat, especially those who offer cauliflower wings as they are one of my favorite dishes. I had gone to sob east in early October specifically for the cauliflower wings, and when I ordered I specifically asked the waitress ""are these vegan, do they have any egg or dairy in the batter"" to which she responded no and I ate them. At the time I was super excited because they were tasty and just what I had been craving. However, recently I decided to return to sob east for a second time for the wings, and out of habit and safety I asked again if they were vegan, to which the server said ""no they have eggs in the batter"". Now I have no idea if between my two visits the recipe changed or if the first server lied to me, either way it's extremely frustrating when I'm no longer able to trust a restaurant to adhere to my dietary restrictions. And while my lifestyle as a vegan is a choice, there are plenty of people who could get sick of not notified of an allergen in their food. Look I'm not trying to sound like a total Karen but trust between a customer and a restaurant is crucial, and sob east lost mine",0,0,4,1,0

For my first drink i had the Fresh From The Garden. It's was amazing. If you like a super refreshing gin drink I highly recommend it. We started with the crab and corn fritters which were phenomenal. The sauce and Mexican corn accompanying the fritters was heaven. For my second drink i had Living in Luxury, another great drink that had the perfect balance of floral and fruity notes. For our entrees my partner had the salmon with brussel sprouts and I had the chopped salad with steak. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Crispy outside with a juicy flaky inside. The brussel sprouts were amazing as well, nice and crispy with little pieces of bacon. My salad was beyond expectation. The steak was cooked perfectly and was so tender and flavorful. There was also a very nice sized portion of steak with my salad. We also got a side of the Gouda Mac and Cheese. I highly recommend getting this. The Gouda gives the Mac and cheese a very unique flavor profile that we couldn't stop indulging in. For dessert the Bread Pudding was the perfect end to our meal, it was baked perfectly and we will definitely be getting it the next time we dine in. Abigail was our server and she did an amazing job at tending to our table. She was able to answer all our questions and was super friendly and hospitable. We will definitely be back.

I ordered close to closing and my food came hot and fresh tasting. The fried chicken tastes like my mom's. This is high praise. I loved that it wasn't spicy and you can add some of their RIDICULOUSLY tasty hot sauce if you want it spicy. I had a breast and a leg and they were both still crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The mac and cheese was topped with crispy fried onions! The mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned (and not too salty!) and the spicy gravy was unexpectedly delicious. But the reason I'm writing this review: I do not like biscuits. BUT THESE. Their angel biscuits are more roll than biscuit and taste exactly like the homemade rolls at my elementary school made 30 years ago. God I'm old. But seriously that unexpected delicious little ""biscuit"" with honey butter just put this meal over the top for me. And still there's more!

Our server Misty has only been employed with Joe's for three weeks but she did a great job. Today was their last day open for two weeks while they secure and moved to another location. The decision on where had not been made as of my visit. I can not give five stars based off this location but will update once we visit the new one. Let's talk about the owner before the food. He is one hard working man. Present on a Sunday, he bussed the tables, took orders, retrieved food, and checked us out. He had to be present in the kitchen because the food coming out was perfect. He even seemed surprised when we spent so little time eating but we don't have to spend hours to enjoy this chicken. If his work ethic is an example of how he runs his business, I have no doubt he will be in business for many more years. We ordered the small family meal with mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and both types of gravy. I had the bomb ass chicken sandwich and we picked up some fried shrimp as an appetizer. All the food was great. The shrimp were fat and the chicken pieces were from large chickens, not those mini ones they serve you in the drive thru stores. Everything was spiced great. They did not cut corners on their last day either which is something I prejudged after I learned of their future plans. We spent nearly forty-five minutes total in the building but did not wait long to be seated. The seats are socially distanced, the staff had masks, and those behind the plexiglass had gloves. You can dine indoors or on the back patio at this location. It was such a beautiful day for both. I don't know what's in that Mayo sauce but it was fantastic. It's a seasoned Mayo with pimentos, Cholula, and a slight twang from what I would imagine to be vinegar. I had to try it on everything! I also have never had angel bread and I don't know how I've lived so long without it. Slightly crunchy with the perfect sweet and salty balance in a soft heavenly roll. I have some feedback about the bathrooms. I understand you're moving but the current bathrooms look like the cleaning process is missing several steps. Consider adding a daily, weekly, and monthly list to your common areas like bathrooms and entry ways to ensure things such as light switches, walls, and cobwebs aren't missed. Give your team ownership of the new areas to guarantee your long term success.",0,4,14,1,0

Very polite and very apologetic when things were delayed. The space is tidy and clean looking. The food itself was also very good. I got the chicken sandwich, and it was in fact ""the bomb"" as it is advertised on the menu. Beats Popeyes and Chik fila easily.  My husband got the catfish and was very happy, save for a little bit too much breading on a few pieces. He also said the fried chicken (leg and thigh pieces) were delicious and fresh. The fries are also excellent, nicely seasoned. The fried green tomatoes were a tad softer than I'd like but I think styrofoam packaging  + steam leant to that. Retoasting them at home fixed this issue. CONS (negative 1 star):The one thing I am concerned about is the wait time. It's not the front of the house staff's fault, I think it's the cooks' fault. From what I saw, they were giving attitude to their front of the house staff and not getting things done on time. There were a few customers I observed that were very upset to have to wait a while for food that should have been done but instead they had to wait half an hour longer.

Price: The sides were reasonably priced ($2-$5)The entrees are around $12Because we all wanted chicken and/or fish, we all purchased the All You Can Eat option for $14. TasteIt was all worth it! Everything was good! The entire table loved the Mac & Cheese and the Potatoes. My friend raved about this place a few weeks ago. So, I promised her that I'd give it a try when I come to Memphis. I'm so glad I did. This place lived up to it's hype.",4,297,105,528,0

The chicken, while tender and cooked just right, wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had. Not even close. I like to season and spice it up. I did not like their hot sauce. It was more of a sweet syrup. I was a bit scared eating this chicken because it was so big. These broilers must have been ten pounds! I've never seen birds this big. It's unnatural. Hormones and steroids are expressly forbidden, but antibiotics and genetic engineering cause them to grow so fast that they can't even walk. They are usually packed 50 million to a square foot anyway so they couldn't walk around if they could, but their bodies grow so fast they nearly explode and that's how they get the meat so tender. I don't really know that much about chickens, but I do raise them, and I know that it's not natural for them to grow this big. Not sure I want to eat genetically raised meat. I ordered the breast and wing. Not expecting the meat to be this big, I also ordered a thigh. I liked the a la carte price of the thigh. $2.25. That was the biggest wing I've ever seen and it had the tenderloin from under the breast attached to it in addition to the wing. The breast seemed to have the same tenderloin so I'm not sure how they butcher it to get the same loin twice. I'm very big on temperature, and they have some problems in that respect. The restaurant who was here before who's name I shall not mention had temperature problems as well. The last meal I ate there came out cold so I sent it back. The second plate they brought me was also cold. They told me they don't have anything in the kitchen to warm food up. I believe it, because my mashed potatoes were room temperature and I refused to eat them. I did not like that gravy either. It reminded me of cheese sauce. Of course I'd have liked it better had it been hot. Conversely, the cole slaw was almost as warm as the potatoes. When I was a kid, I thought it was called cold slaw. That's because it's supposed to be cold! You can't just leave it out all day! It has to be below 40*! I refused to eat the slaw too. I really liked the bread. As for the chicken, they brought it out within about 5 minutes which is not enough time to cook it to order. Mine was probably 120* which is good for serving. It will still burn the mouth, but I know it was 160-170* when it comes out of the oil. I know it had been sitting a few minutes, but if they don't have any way to warm food up, I can see how it could be served cold. All in all, I liked the batter and the skin. I did not like the seasoning or hot sauce. The chicken is too big to be natural. It is flavorful and juicy. Maybe a bit greasy even. In the end, I left full of chicken and didn't pay too much.",0,201,23,8,0

Let me start off by saying the food was very good, hence the two stars. However, the drinks and the service my table received was unacceptable! It took my waiter a while to come to the table upon sitting down. When he did come, we (me and my friend) placed our order and ordered two apple-pineapple (I cannot remember the exact name of the drink) margarita. When we received the margaritas it tasted like straight apple juice. Our waiter, again, took a while to come back to our table, so I went to the bar myself and brought the drinks and asked for new drinks and the bartender told me that he could not make new drinks, he can only listen to what I thought would make the drink better and go from there...As confusing as that sounds, I asked him to add more alcohol. I received the drinks back and this time our ordinal margaritas now tasted like medicine. When our waiter came to bring us our food, I asked him to bring two glasses of water and that he could take these margaritas back. He looked at me confused because the drinks looked like they had not been touched, before asking me why I asked him to take them back. I told him that the drinks were not good. Me and my friend ate our food and asked for our bill.When we received our bill we were shocked that we were charged for the margaritas. Keep it mind, we had just traveled from Ohio, it was late, we were tired and the bar was about to close. However, the responses to follow had me quite appalled. I told the waiter that I would pay for the margaritas, but the next time a guest comes into the restaurant, do not charge them for anything that they do not like, let alone do not eat/drink.The waiter then explained to me that the reason why they could not take the drinks back was because ""they could not get the alcohol back."" He goes on to say, ""if we take the drink back, the establishment is left with nothing. We cannot pour the alcohol back into the bottle."" I was speechless because who in the world would expect anyone to pour alcohol back into the original bottle?! He then goes on to say that this has been the case at everyone restaurant and/or bar he has ever worked at. I had to keep myself from laughing because I truly could not believe what I was hearing. I told the waiter that I was not from here, and if this is how things were done, fine, but that is not good customer service. Sometimes as a business you have to eat the cost. I watched the bartender give a woman at the bar another beer because she did not like the one she originally received. Did the bartender put a cap on the beer and re-refrigerate it? The mentality at this place raised a lot of questions and has now warranted a no return from me. If one working in the service industry does not know that their job is to serve the guest/customer with the upmost courtesy, then I believe some need to rethink the industry that they are in.",0,0,15,7,0

I read some reviews about their ""goodies"" and decided to go with the Onion Rings, Famous Fries and the Sam I Am - all good choices.First, the beer battered Onion Rings were HUGE - in size and flavor. The part I was not expecting - but did enjoy - was the Spicy Part. The Cayenne pepper mixed into the batter. Now I like Spicy, so this was a hit for me. My wife, not so much - a bit too much for her. But the ring were so Big AND flavorful, they got my vote!Second, I had read about their awesome fries - and good they were, quite so. In fact, a couple of folks in our group got the Basket of Fries. I simply got the side order with my Sam I Am.Third, the Sam I Am was fairly good, but not sooo Gouda. I was actually expecting a larger sandwich, and with more Gouda - what Gouda I did get had melted out and stuck to the sandwich wrapper - I was disappointed. However, since I had filled up on the Onion Rings and Fries, I don't know if I could have eaten a bigger sandwich.On the whole, it was a good experience, food-wise, for my first visit. I must admit, though, that they had the music cranked up a bit more than I expected for a lunch visit. They do have live music as well, which I am guessing would make for a great night visit. I would come back. Why don't you check it our for yourself.",0,48,2,0,0

Remodeling. Excellent value! Did someone say dipped Italian beef? I'm all over that one! There was so much meat in this one. It is a little messy if you order it dipped in broth, but I was able to eat it with my hands. I would order it again, but probably with the broth on the side, or not at all. I would not recommend dipped if you take it to eat later.They packaged mine to go, I guess by mistake, but were serving others in baskets. I normally don't care for crinkle fries, but these were just the right amount of soft, the right amount of crisp, and the right amount of salt. In scientific terms, this is called Goldie Locks French Fries. They sell ground beef tacos, which are my favorite, and I really wanted to try one. They only sell tacos three at a time. The owner told me it's because of how they portion the meat, but he gets that request all the time, and in a month or so, he will sell just one! I wanted to try something else, but after eating that sandwich, there just wasn't anything small on the menu that would finish me off.The place looks like a dump. This is a dangerous part of town. The building is old and worn out. There is broken down kitchen equipment in the hallway to the bathroom. The ceiling is torn up. The owner says they are remodeling, and tore the ceiling out to paint and have an open exposed ceiling. He also told me he is expanding his menu and adding fish! My suggestion would be to lock the door, put a sign out front saying under construction, focus on your work, finish what you are doing, and then re-open. I wouldn't remodel a little bit at a time while still serving customers.As bad as it looks inside and out, the health score is a 94. Not bad. I will overlook this because it is only temporary. The food and value were exceptional, so I think it is worthy of five stars.4/4/16. I have been thinking about this place non stop and just had to come back and try those tacos. The were different but certainly did not disappoint. Soft corn shells with cheese melted on them and the ground beef was excellent. I ordered a hot dog and loved it. I especially like the pickle in it. The tacos and dog each came with an order of fries. 3 tacos, 2 fries, 2 sodas 1 dog for $10.00! No improvement on the renovation since last visit.8/12/16. Wings were good, but just so average. They did nothing to make them special. If you want really hot wings, they don't have anything hotter than generic wing sauce.

His Italian beef is excellent and I would recommend it extra dry with the jus on the side like a French dip or thoroughly dunked if you like a sandwich that runs down your elbows like me.

Came in to grab lunch today after looking at their menu online and seeing that they have a special where you get a salad and a 9 ounce smoothie for $9.Perfect! The place was easy to find with plenty of parking. It looks a lot like an old liquor store. I walk in and there's a man standing behind the counter who doesn't offer much of a greeting. I tell him what I'd like and much to my surprise he tells me it will be $17+. I clarify that I'd like the special for $9 and he looks confused. A woman preparing food says that special is only offered at the downtown location. I was surprised as it didn't say that online but though, hey! I love to support small business anyway so okay. Well after I pay and they are preparing my food I see that on the menu posted IN THEIR RESTAURANT, the special is in fact advertised. I say ""excuse me, the salad and smoothie deal is right here on your menu."" To which the woman replied with, ""I said what I said. I'm not doing this with you."" So I reply with ""and I said what I said. The deal is right here."" On another day of push a bit more given these clearly illegal business practices but today I wasn't feeling well and decided that I would simply never again spend my dollars here. So now they've just lost out on what would have probably been a frequent customer due to horrendous customer service and business practices. Separately, I ordered the mango lassi as my smoothie and the cashier told me to grab one from the back refrigerator. The label on that smoothie said it was made on October 30 - 6 days ago! I asked for a fresh smoothie, particularly given the price I just paid. But no matter what, it is completely unacceptable to sell week old smoothies to people. Unfortunately, this ""smoothie"" is not fresh anyway. The one they prepared in front of me is simply a powder. No mangos were harmed in the making of this smoothie. The salad? It did not contain any cilantro, citrus slices, or sesame seeds as indicated on the menu. The cilantro and citrus are my favorite ingredients and pretty key to an Asian salad. The chicken was DRY.

RP Tracks was close and fit the bill. We got the buffalo tofu fingers for an appetizer. They're fried tofu sticks drowned in Frank's Red Hot. They come with ranch or bleu cheese sauce, neither of which is vegan, so they let us substitute their tasty vegan tomato dijon aioli. For entrees I got the vegetarian tofu club which is vegan as-is except for the honey wheat bread. It was great! The tofu was prepared well and it comes with that same tasty aioli. My partner ordered the BBQ tofu. It was good, but the cole slaw wasn't vegan and an alternative side wasn't offered. Both came with fries; I got steak fries and he got waffle fries. Both versions were delicious fried potato goodness. The service was good. Our server was really nice and gave us great advice on local bars. We did have to ask a lot of questions as the menu makes no effort to identify items as vegetarian or vegan, and in turn, our server had to ask the kitchen some questions. No big deal, but it could save everyone some time if the kitchen would provide that info up front so the menu could be labeled and the waitstaff informed.My biggest complaint was the amount of cigarette smoke drifting in from the jerks smoking RIGHT outside the front door. Not the the bar's fault at all, since they provide plenty of outdoor space for smokers to take themselves and their habit. Perhaps the bar could post a notice by the door to remind smokers that the entire outdoor area is their oyster; there's no need to huddle by the front door and make the front of the restaurant a ""smoking section.""

We LOVE your sweet potatoes fries as to one reason why we're returning customers. We got there a little after 11am, opening time. I was on the hunt for a chicken sandwich & my husband fried pickles. Our waiter was a laid back, kind gentleman with a ponytail. We told him how much we love coming here because of the sweet potatoes fries! He then started to take our order and my husband asked if they served fried pickles. The waiter responded, ""I'm not sure, let me go check."" He proceeds to go to the back and later tells us that they DO serve fried pickles but you'll have to order them but you'll have to order them in their dish ""Lots of stuff"" (I'm not sure of the name). My husband agreed because he LOVES fried pickles (not kidding). When the waiter came back with our food, my husband didn't have any fried pickles on his plate so he asked the waiter about them. ""Oh are they not in there?"" replies the waiter. Me & my husband said ""No.""He then left and came back and said that they were out of fried pickles.The waiter looked at the plate and said, ""I'm sorry, those were fried mushrooms not fried pickles."" Basically admiting that he had got the fried mushrooms mistaken for the fried pickles.A little disappointed my husband let the waiter know that the only reason why he wanted to order that meal was strictly because of the fried pickles. The waiter asked him if he wanted something else and he replied ""Yes."" The waiter came back with a manager (not sure who she is, she never introduced or greeted us once we were at the table), short lady with short dark blonde/brown hair.She didn't greet us usually how managers would greet a customer with a problem. First thing out of her mouth was, ""What's wrong with it?"". We told her nothing was wrong with the food, is was just not what he ordered. My husband explained the only reason he ordered the dish that he did was because the waiter had told him that fried pickles came with it. The manager said ""Is there fried pickles on the menu?. The waiter replied, ""No, it was the fried mushrooms on the plate instead of fried pickles."" Sort of admiting to us that he made an error. After explaining the situation about us receiving incorrect information about the menu to the manager she turned around and sarcastically said, ""Ok..."" Hungry, my husband told them never mind about his food. We didn't want to eat at a place where they treat the customers like they're unintelligent and in the wrong for speaking up when they receive an incorrect order (or rude/unpleasant staff). Instead of fixing the problem, either the waiter admitting his mistake to management or having my husband order something else from the menu, they made it seem like we were bothering them or not worth it.My husband payed for my meal, after asking the waiter to take off the charge for the meal my husband didn't eat (or order; no fried pickles).We would've stayed to eat but we decided to leave due to the terrible encounter with that woman (manager on duty?) The waiter was nice but almost looked scared of the manager he was with (the short lady with short hair). He never once while we were talking with the lady said that it was him who told us that they serve fried pickles. The manager was treating us as if we were customers who knew exactly what they were getting and just didn't want it anymore (from the beginning my husband never received what he ordered). Sucks because we really enjoyed the food, location & service there at Tracks. Unfortunately we will not be back! Customer service is the heartbeat for local businesses here in Memphis. Unsatisfactory customer service can make or break a company regardless the reputation or how good the menu is.

I'm still trying to make the best of a rough start to dinner so far and we dig in.  I will say it all did taste pretty damn good.  Steak was high quality and was good despite being undercooked.  Crab Legs were tasty as well and I appreciated not having to crack them as they were cut in half for us.  In hindsight I wish I would have asked for another round of hot plates to try and heat things up as we ate.  10 or so minutes later my potatoes arrive...  they were good too, but a little over cooked I thought.  Corrine stops by and tells us that it wasn't the chefs fault, but hers about the potatoes.  I honestly do not care whose fault it was and I am not sure why it was even mentioned.  Charity and I are just kind of stunned at this point...  this is not at all what we expected to find here.  This reminds me of a Longhorn Steakhouse visit honestly.  Crappy hostess, bad table, terrible attention to detail, wrong and poorly prepared food, and an inattentive manager all in one place.  We tear up the Crab Legs and eat as much of the meat as we can and are ready to get out of there.  Corrine has gotten slammed it seemed and becomes really slow to get anything for anyone.  While just sitting there we watch another table's food get dropped off and sit near the server station in the walkway.  Several people look at the food and the ticket, but no one delivers it until Corrine shows up to do it.  We are still just sitting, waiting, with debit card in hand ready to go for when she arrives. Corrine finally makes it to us, sees the card, and says, ""we have a cake for his birthday"". ""Alright, but why isn't it already in your hand?"", I thought. We wait for the cake until it arrives, which at this point felt like an eternity.  Cake was pretty tasty as well...We get the check, Corrine boxes up the cake and the raw steak for us after insisting I take it with me for a morning ""breakfast treat"".If just one or two of the issues I described had occurred it would have just been brushed off and I would have probably not written a review.  The fact that all of these things happened to us during one visit at a place that should be better than this really kind of sucks.  I never mention price because I think it's relative, but the Steak and Crab dish with the late ass potatoes was $200.  You shouldn't feel the way we did after spending that on dinner.",4,46,515,881,1

It was perfect! The food was amazing, the server (Chelsea) was great, and the value was pretty good too. All of the food had great flavor and it was all cooked perfectly.  We started with the:Calamari - $16Lightly battered in seasoned flour, fried crisp and finished with a slightly spicy ancho chili mayonnaise   *It was AMAZING!!!Our Entrees:(Mrs.) - Petite Filet Mignon - $368 ounces, fully trimmed *It was tender and flavorful! DELICIOUS.(Mr.) - I tried one of the specials, The ""sampler"" which was three 4oz filet mignon medallions - $62(Each medallion was served with a different ""enhancer"".  #1. Topped with Maytag Blue Cheese Crumbles, #2. seasoned with salt and cracked black pepper on top of Maker's Mark peppercorn sauce, #3. Topped with  Crabmeat Béarnaise.)*This was an excellent choice and my absolute favorite of the three, hands down, was the Maker's Mark peppercorn!!!! My wife tried everything and agreed! 2nd place was the Maytag Blue Cheese which was also amazing. The Crabmeat Béarnaise kinda tasted like macaroni and I'm in no rush to have that again with these other options available... hahaha. Our sides:Sautéed Mushrooms - $9*I would order these sliced next time instead of whole. Green Bean Gruyere Casserole with Tobacco Onions - 9*Second FavoriteGarlic Potato Casserole - 9* Our favorite. The sides were a good portion for two people each. We probably should have only ordered two sides in stead of three because we couldn't Finnish them. Add in some refreshments, and you are looking at about $214 plus gratuity. It was a TON of food!I've spent far more for far less that didn't even compare so I was very pleased.

We ordered the jalapeño Mac and cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, and asparagus. All sides were good, except the Mac and cheese which we all found to be very underwhelming. The spinach casserole however was one of the best things I have ever tasted. I can't recommend it enough! To end the meal we ordered the bread pudding in whiskey sauce which was good, but nothing special. Our waitress was very helpful and attentive and made sure we were taken care of the whole time.

And I'm not quite sure I can reverse engineer their seasons from the short period of time a piece passed my palate...but it's subtle, savory and makes every bite delish!There's also entrees for non-meat eaters too.

Located at Overton Square in midtown. Bayou bar and grill is the perfect way to take that gastronomical journey into the heart of the bayou. Enjoy Muffaletta's Po Boys Beignets & all your other New Orleans favorites in their spacious bar and dining areas. Pair your meal from the finest selections in beer & wines offered. Offering the best local & known variety of beer on tap or well. Wines by the bottle or glass there's something for everyone. You're gonna love the way it tastes I garontee.    Having lived in the Memphis area 26 years. Bayou's is my go to for good cajun food & gator dishes. I was luckly surprised being Gator chili was available on the menu along with my favorite appetizer classic of zydeco wings. Before having gator chili I decided to savor some zydeco wings drenched in their house specialty sauce offering some heat to those who love it hot (like myself) while enjoying the wings juicy warm most tenderness Seasoned to perfection.  Indulging in gator chili I thought was an excellent choice finding how thick the chili is along with how the Gators consistency was like pulled pork barbecue having the taste of chicken but better.    The atmosphere here is reminiscent of bars you'd find on Bourbon Street. Adorned in decor found in any cajun style restaurants with patrons having a good time enjoying a Saints game on the big screens. I refuse to eat outside on the patio myself. Its small space & overcrowding makes me find the patio dining a lackluster experience & my preference is dining in a spacious enough area that seats crowds comfortably. My overall dining experience was excellent & I am anticipating on another visit indulging & sampling other menu items as they looked rather delicious. Enjoying a bit of their cajun hospitality I would like to credit my attentive server for friendly and courteous service. Bayou's kitchen chefs have their cooking game down pack in plating presentation prep. & Their overall attention to detail in every app & entree.

The food menu has expanded a little and some of the newer items are a nice add. The late-night option is great, even though the slimmer late menu is used during the week. Coming here on weekends and getting a full menu at 11pm is a very nice option. It's actually a big deal to get the full menu because theyreally set themselves apart with their excellent selection of New Orleans themed appetizers. I like most of the apps and there's a lot to choose from like the Crab Stuffed Shrimp, Fried Shrimp Basket [these are the jumbo shrimp], Fried Oyster Basket [they do a panko coating on all their fried food which gives it a nice crisp], Popcorn Shrimp Basket [all the baskets comes with fries & dipping sauces], Alligator Nachos &  these are pretty tasty [tortilla chips with gator chili, swiss & cheddar cheese, sour cream & diced jalapeños], Cheese Poppers, Jalapeño  Cheese Poppers w/ fries, Bayou Hot Wings [they're not breaded], Spiced Shrimp [it's a dozen peel-n-eat shrimp with hot cocktail sauce], Popcorn Crawfish Basket [one of late night favorites], Catfish Beignet Basket, Bar-b-que Andouille & Cheddar plate, Chicken Breast Strips, Potato Skins, Fried Pickle Spears, Hot Spinach & Artichoke Dip with tortilla chips, Alligator Chili Fries, Seafood Parmesan Dip [that's shrimp & crabmeat in a parmesan sauce with tortilla chips, and any NOLA theme apps menu would not complete without oysters. Yep  they've got Oysters On The Half Shell for $5.50 1/2 doz. or Lagniappe $8.95 and Beinvill, Rockefeller, or Half & Half. Eat up!!! While their Broths Of The Bayou aren't actually apps, you can get them in a cup, half or full bowl,  I most often get me some as a starter. Like the Red Beans And Rice, Alligator Chili, Seafood Gumbo, Duck And Sausage Gumbo, Shrimp And Crawfish Bisque, and the Bayou Broth Sampler which is a flight of all of them. There's also your basic salads which are pretty good so between the apps, broths & salads you can get pretty full before you get to an entree, I usually don't order anything beyond these and quite frankly they don't have anything all that special beyond here anyway. Don't get me wrong, they have some decent burgers, club & chicken sandwiches but my personal favorite is the Muffeletta but as for entrees they only have Catfish Acadian [smothered with shrimp & crawfish in acadian sauce with dirty rice and spinach] Cajun Catfish which is special because it's spicy fried catfish  with cajun wing sauce, cajun green beans & dirty rice, Blackened Grouper, Ancho Crab Sauce Grouper [pan seared grouper topped with an ancho pepper crab sauce], Cajun Shrimp Jacuzzi [shrimp, scallop and crab casserole] & Louisiana Stuffed Shrimp. The only things left are some deserts and the Key Lime Pie is just okay. They really could use better lighting, and they know it, because some people have to use their flashlight on their phones while ordering, and it's just too dark everywhere inside. It's part of the reason I can't give a 5 star but also there is a bit of inconsistency with the cooks, e.g. usually the crawfish basket has a big pile of very lightly breaded mudbugs with a light golden brown cook and occasionally there's a smaller portion cooked a little too long. Tht's disappointing but overall not enough to keep me away & certainly not going to stop me from my regular drop-in for late night mudbugs or a  lunchtime muffeleta, indeed.The marble tables made it on the move which was a big deal for me, I only have one antique item in my home and it's a marble table lamp and I bought it because the white marble was so cool. The white marble tables are very cool and they look like they are antique and remind me of one if my favorite old cafes in Nawlins.Bottom line: I will drop by here, especially late night, for some alligator chili or crawfish basket and if I'm in the area during the day and feel like a muffeletta and cup of gumbo this will be my choice. It's also a good place to grab a drink, a cold beer and wings to catch a game. It's comfy inside & outside is very laid back.",53,1040,885,7495,1

Small portion and served with an even smaller amount of bread to dip it with. Shouldn't a ""grille"" know how to cook steak? Is that asking for too much? The steak had 0 flavor.

We both enjoy the food at The Majestic and decided we wanted to go. Did you know that it started as a silent movie theater over 100 years ago? (This is why they're showing old movies on ""the big screen"" while you're eating). What a great decision we made. Oh, since so many people do go to The Majestic when they go to the Orpheum, it's always a good idea to make a reservation, or go early enough to get a seat at the bar. Actually, I did call for a reservation, but was told they were booked up before Hamilton. We decided to go a bit earlier and did get seated at a table upstairs. We had great service too.My wife enjoyed her Salmon. I opted to go with the Grilled Pork Tenderloin which came with Maple-glazed carrots. The tenderloin was quite tasty, moist, tender and well-seasoned. Although it was served on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes, it was the Maple-glazed carrots that truly grabbed my taste buds on this visit. They were sliced thin and well-flavored with maple and butter. They simply melted in my mouth. Delicious meal.As great as the dinner was, we also had a good dessert afterwards. I went with the Oreo Chocolate Mousse while my wife went with the Tiramisu. The best part - the smaller servings are the right amount of dessert after you enjoy your incredible dinner.

It's got a nice ambiance - slightly retro - with the period being set by a giant screen in the back of the restaurant projecting old movies in black and white. Being seated off to the side in a booth, I didn't see it outside of coming into the restaurant, but I could see that being a little distracting if your table is facing it straight on. Service was very attentive and straightforward, and our food and drinks came out in a very timely fashion. I didn't sample the drinks as much because I was pleasantly surprised by the Singapore Sling - it came out more balanced and not as supremely sweet as some that I had over in that part of the world - that I stuck with it for a few rounds.Along with solid beverages, the food here is also quite good as well. The crab cakes were a tasty starter - not too large but easy to share, and with a really nice crisp done that adds a nice crunch and texture to each bite. I went with a straightforward main - a filet done medium - and it was very flavorful on its own, with my only criticism being that it was cooked a little more towards medium-rare once I got to the middle of the steak. The side of garlic mashed potatoes were also good for soaking up the excess juices from the meat, and the chopped-up potatoes meant you had a bit more texture than you'd find from the whipped/pureed variety.In all, the food here isn't trying to do anything too revolutionary, but it's all executed quite well and is delicious and pretty affordable to boot (there's a great theater menu that runs under $30 for 3 courses!).

(order sauce on the side)We walked from Beale Street over, it's a few minutes walk to get there. Easy. When you arrive, you get in a line and order at the register. You receive a number and place it on your table. The drinks are self-serve. Soft drinks, tea and sweet tea are all available. There is also beer on tap and more!  In fact, the desserts looked awesome, but we didn't try any unfortunately. We tried a three meat combo: ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. It includes 3 side: we tried Mac-n-cheese, green beans, and homemade chips.We also had the half-slab rib combo with potato salad and pork rinds.Add some sweet tea and you have a classic barbecue meal.Ribs - tender, deep flavor, great plain - no need for sauce! The meat pulls off the bone easily and is just so good. If you like dry rub, you will love these ribs. Some of the best I've had.Pulled Pork - this was dry to me, tasty smoky flavor, but the pork was better at BB Kings on Beale Street in the nachos. The pieces were cut up so small it was hard to make a small sandwich with the buns. I added some sauce and it made it much better.Brisket - my least favorite. It wasn't tender, no flavor really, and I think brisket from Texas BBQ places are much better.Mac and Cheese - this was just okay. Cheesy for sure, but not much to it. I've had better elsewhere.Green Beans - not my favorite - bland, but not dry. They weren't special in any particular way.Potato Salad - if you like potato salad, this one is up there in taste and flavor. It's mustard based, but it had a good flavor.Pork Rinds - WOW - I loved these. So simple, with a little seasoning, but boy did these taste great. I wish we had a double order of these.Homemade Chips - simple deep-fried chips, these were okay.The sauces:Mustard-Based - the BEST one - it had a little bite, but was great on the pork!Vinegar-based - this was definitely full of vinegar, but it was good with the pork too.Mild - sweet tasting and good dipping the ribs in.Hot - spicier, but not too much.

Maybe they're known for their pork BBQ or ribs and if thats that case, I'll eat my poor review bc I haven't eaten pork since 1998 so I wouldn't know about that. Here is what we got and how the food was...*1/2 BBQ chicken plate, wet, with fries and greens: Chicken skin was nice and crispy, absolutely no flavor though. Sauce was only on about 1/4 of the meat. IDK what ""wet"" means to them, but I should have needed a napkin to eat that meat and I didn't. Fries were okay. But I mean, it's hard to mess up fried potatoes. Greens were mushy and very very very overcooked with no flavor except salt that I could taste.  *Pulled chicken sandwich with sauce and Mac n cheese: The chicken was cold, literally like it had just been taken from the fridge and someone squirted some bbq sauce on it. All of the pulled meat was NOT covered in bbq sauce. They literally placed the cold meat on a warm bun, added ONE squirt of sauce and sent it on their way. Meat was dry. We needed a lot of water. Mac n cheese was stove top Mac n cheese. No flavor at all except cheese. Absolutely nothing to write home about or remember in this meal. Didnt eat more than 1/4 of it. We gave the rest of the meat to the stray cat that was on the patio. *Portobello salad with house dressing and no cheese: This is the ONLY reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of one. The salad comes in a huge fried tortilla bowl which is crispy and delicious. I got it with the house dressing which was surprisingly VERY flavorful! It tasted like a mix of bbq sauce and a vinaigrette. It has 3-4 grilled portobellos which were juicy ad seasoned very well, tomato slices, pepperoncini peppers and lettuce. Saltine crackers on the side which ive never had on a salad before but now I feel like they must go on EVERY salad in life, ever. I took this salad to go and added an avocado to it when I got home and it traveled our 7 hour road trip back to Atlanta very well. Huge portion, could easily feed 2 people for an appetizer or one person for a meal.  All in all, I would come back to this BBQ joint for the Portobello salad and that's it. That salad it really good.

Pulled pork sandwich was particularly dry while the ribs didn't have much flavor besides a smoky outer park (where's the dry rub!?). -------------------------------------------------------------------------I have seen reviews from several St. Louisans, and there seems to be a common theme that Central BBQ is a bit over-rated. As others have mentioned, the meat was particularly dry. The pulled pork sandwich had a good portion of pork on it, which I appreciate, but it was so dry. Even the slaw on top and lots of bbq sauce, barely helped.The ribs were also relatively disappointing. The only other time I've had Memphis ribs was at BB Kings off Beale St, and they were amazing, so I assumed Central would be that much better. The ribs at Central were cooked very well. They were juicy, and soft enough for you to pull a bone out with ease, but not so soft that it disintegrated into pulled rib meat when eating. The flavor is where I had some qualms. The ribs at BB Kings had great dry rub on it, these ribs didn't seem to have anything. They had a good smoky char, but that was it in terms of flavor. The fries were also a little disappointing, like a mix between Mcdonald's fries and steak fries in that they were slightly smaller than steak fries, and a little floppy like Mcdonald's fries. They had a good seasoning on them, I just wish it had more of it.All in all, this was a pretty underwhelming Memphis BBQ experience.

When we arrived at the restaurant, there was a line out the door. A bouncer enforced social distancing, but soon we were inside. There's a huge menu board on the wall, and the popularity of the place means you'll have lots of time to decide what to order. You place your order and pay at the counter. Drinks are picked up from the bar. I'm not sure if this is an ""age of COVID"" system, but it's confusing if you're a first-timer. We selected a smoked turkey plate with green beans and macaroni and cheese, and a combo rib plate with fries and chips (my husband loves potatoes, lol). I wanted unsweetened iced tea, and I was delighted when the young woman taking our order told me that the tea only comes in half gallon jugs. Yes, please! (I drank every last drop of the tea, it was absolute Southern perfection -- freshly brewed and strong)!It took a while for our food to arrive, but it was fresh and hot. Hubby loved his ribs on the initial bite, but soon became disappointed. He said they were fine, but not even close to the best he'd ever had. I felt the same way about my turkey. It was a breast sliced thin and was tender and smoky, but it was just okay. Adding on a little house sauce made it better, but the sweetness became too much quickly. The sides were the most disappointing. Served in very small plastic cups, you get about 3 bites of food. The green beans were decent, but the macaroni and cheese was unacceptable. When I ordered it, I expected true Southern style mac & cheese -- you know the kind: tender noodles baked with real cheese. This tasted similar to the frozen t.v. dinner type mac & cheese. Not bad, but a real letdown. The roll was out of a bag and not worth eating. We spent $60 on this meal including tax and tip, and I felt it was overpriced. There has to be much better bbq in the Memphis area, and I would recommend trying someplace different if you can only eat a couple of meals in town.",5,1003,1570,8854,1

It was light enough that it didn't spoil my appetite for my main entree.As a self-proclaimed burger snob, I had to order the SOB Burger. It was one of the biggest burgers I've ever had in Memphis, and it was so, so good. The large beef patty was cooked perfectly. It was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The American cheese was spilling over the sides of the patty. The caramelized onions, house pickles and SOB sauce added a slightly sweet note to each bite. I could have done without the lettuce and tomato, but they had no major impact on the sandwich. The sesame seed-covered bun was fluffy, buttered and slightly crispy around the edge. Overall, each bite was delicious.The fries, unfortunately, were a bit of a miss. They were hand-cut but lacked any crispiness, resulting in limp and mushy fries. While the seasoning was spot-on, I just couldn't get past the texture. But after the giant burger I had just devoured, I didn't have much room for the fries.Our waitress was great and I really liked the atmosphere.

These were my favorite part of the meal. The aioli sauce was a great complement to the fried goodness. I got the duck fried rice which was pretty good but a little bland. Wife got spinach artichoke dip appetizer. Parents split a salad and a burger. My daughter had a side of Mac and cheese. All that came to a total of $90.

The drinks are also very good and offers something different that your typical bar order. The service could really use some nurturing. I've visited twice and when visiting, I didn't get the impression that my service or time spent dining here was appreciated or welcomed. The server was very slow to tend to my table. It took about 15min to place my drink order, about 15min later to place the food order, then about another 15min for the food to arrive. I'm usually pretty flexible and understanding of busy service times and low staff due to COVID restrictions; however, I had this experience with the service on both occasions and neither time was the place packed or over-crowded for the ratio of the staff. Each time I placed an order, whether it was for drinks or food, I had to flag down someone (not my server) as my server continue to bypass my table to assist other guest. I literally watched a party enter after me, be served their food before me, and pay their check and leave...before me. I spoke with the manager and he apologized for the inconvenience, didn't really own the negative experience that I had.

Therefore, I chose express. I wanted to make the most of my visit, so I selected shrimp, steak, shredded chicken, and shredded beef and the birria. Once I got home, I ate both the shrimp & steak tacos and they were AMAZING! There were so many tasty shrimp that I had enough to save for my chicken taco for later. The sauce on the shrimp taco was good too. The steak was flavorful as well. However, I nibbled on the chicken and it was just ok. I just sampled the beef and it's good. All tacos were dressed in pico and lettuce and that helped give some nice flavor. The guacamole cream sauce was hot as advertised. But, the birria was hot. I only had a few bites and am thinking of ways to tone it down when I eat it for lunch. The next day for lunch, I ate the birria with rice and beans and it was very tasty and tolerable.

There appears to be a lack of overall attentiveness that has a widespread negative impact to the customers.

Of course we were greeted and seated immediately. My husband ordered the Hey Lucy omelet and I had the traditional- soft scramble eggs, house made sausage patties and potatoes. The food came out very quickly and was all very hot. As usual the eggs needed seasoning- most breakfast places want you to season to your liking- but I was very happy with my soft scramble. The potatoes didn't seem freshly cut but had great flavor. The highlight was the housemade sausage patties! Wow did they have delicious flavor. I highly recommend getting them with whatever dish you choose. We both ate almost every bite off of our plates which is unusual for us, especially at a breakfast place. Staff was warm and welcoming.

I only have two complaints. I joined the waitlist on Yelp at 10:30 am. Someone in my party checked in at 11:20. I got a call around 11:30 from the restaurant. I arrived at noon and told the hostess I had joined the waitlist on Yelp and she gaslit me saying I was not on the list and nobody from the restaurant would've called me and maybe I was thinking of their other location on Park. After showing her my call log and the waitlist I had joined at 10:30 am, she magically found my name on the list. This is not the first time this happened to me eating here. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time and our waitress was great even though the restaurant was busy. I ordered the classic French toast, an extra side of breakfast potatoes, and a half order of beignets. Everything came out staggered which I had no issue with. The beignets came out last, and I noticed they were significantly smaller than the last time I dined there. I asked my waitress about the size and she was gracious enough to offer to send them back. I appreciated the offer but not wanting to make her job harder, I kept the beignets. The food was great and aside from check-in the service was great too! I will be back!",0,173,7,5,0

The primary problem? Extraordinary amounts of time waiting. And waiting. We hopped online to get our name on the wait list since it was a crazy weekend day. Clearly, everyone wants breakfast at the same time at all of the breakfast/brunch places across Memphis. Like...everyone.So we checked in with the semi-friendly hostess and we waited a REALLY long time for a table. There were 5 of us; 3 adults and 2 kids...and the kids started getting pretty restless. There aren't many places to sit and wait....so the front gets pretty cluster-ey (especially as soon as that party of 12 shows up and there's literally nowhere to move.......)Once we finally got to a table, we were able to get orders in fairly quickly...but this ain't no NYC Greek diner. The food took days to arrive. (I exaggerate sometimes). But this whole thing was a serious time commitment. Thankfully I was with family that I enjoy being with...so that made the loss of my morning worthwhile.The food was OK; nothing special. Our server was really nice and was running around like crazy...but the kitchen made some mistakes and one of our meals was missing for the first 10-ish minutes after 4 of the 5 orders came out.

The staff setup the tables outside and seated the group.  The server they had went out to begin to get orders, not sure what happened at that point but they were not happy with her.  They all come back into restaurant and sit in a non designated table space near our table.  Our server comes to check and let us know our food is coming out....I requested she cover our mimosa pitcher as she did.  The manager came past and requested the group to move to the front or to their vehicles until there table would be ready.  They moved but were upset that he asked.  Our food arrived as they were leaving, the restaurant staff did a GREAT JOB in this situation.  People we live in a COVID ERA, restaurant employees are not making there usual wages.  We should all just be more considerate with the entire process of Restaurant Service as they are doing the best they can under COVID Requirements.  Again, it's the CHOICES WE MAKE AS CONSUMERS in society.  See you soon Another Broken Egg!",2,46,348,263,1

They also did really well with supplying bottled water due to Memphis's waterline situation. Their biscuits and beignets are sublime, and they come with a honey side that complements it perfectly.The reason I gave three stars is because of the eggs benedict... They were just edible. The hollaindaise tasted like really bland cheese sauce. I always say a restaurant should never offer benedict if they can't make good hollaindaise. At least use store-bought so it'll have taste.Also, the poached eggs were completely solid. Overcooked by probably three minutes  Tomatos weren't fresh either but not really complaining about that. The bacon was really good though!Overall, it really wasn't bad. I just really love eggs benedict lmao",7,133,44,81,1

We placed ourselves on the waiting list for 11:30AM and only had to wait 10-15 mins after to be seated. The restaurant was honoring the social distancing and wearing of masks guidelines. We ordered a pitcher of The Strawberry St. Germain Mimosa (you can get 4 flutes (give or take) out of it) and it was delicious with the right amount of champagne, fruit, and flavoring. I ordered the Lobster & City Grits (seasonal item) + a side of The Maple Apple Chicken Sausage and it was very good. The only complaint I have is that the bacon (within the Lobster & City Grits) was too soft (as I like mine a little more well done). Two of my other friends ended up ordering the same thing as I and they enjoyed their meal as well. Their only complaint was the small portion of garlic bread that came with the meal. The last friend ordered Grilled Chicken & Waffles + a Side of Grits. It definitely was a healthier spin on the classic meal but she enjoyed her meal. Overall, we had a great time with good food!

Smaller than normal but very good, warm and plenty of powder sugar. Average coffee, very small cup. Bloody Mary was average flavor and fair sized. Princess had one very plain Belgian waffle, large and soft. The eggs Benedict was one of the worst ever. The ham and english muffin were good, large soft, hot. The eggs were not poached but hard boiled, and the hollandaise sauce was more like gravy, thick, zero egg or lemon taste at all. Side of potatoes were frozen or reheated, over cooked hard and bland. Everything was hot and presented well, but not even average flavor.

Oooh boy, is this place good!First, the basics about their operations...Huge plus #1: Online Ordering!!Huge plus #2: curbside pickup!!Pricing?: very reasonable. I'm cheap, so outside of big events I don't like to spend a ton on food. I was able to order online, swing by on lunch, park at the curb, text that I was there, and they brought it out to my car! That is service I can get used to and will increase my visits here! Can't speak on the inside yet. Now for the food...Oooh, my tummy is happy and full!Ordered the spicy shrimp rice bowl and a spicy crab mi roll. Original plan was to get the curry soba noodle bowl, but it wasn't showing up on the online ordering, so change of plans... (a happy change)Now one downside I have about ordering shrimp dishes at a lot of places is the fact that you don't get much shrimp a lot of times, so doesn't always seem worth it. Let me say, that is not the case in this bowl!! Tons of shrimp, cooked to perfection and flavored to a tee!The spicy sauce was a great addition for it (comes on the side); and the kale, corn, grilled onions, and carrots all blended great together. Overall the bowl was substantial and extremely filling. I tend to eat larger meals than I should (I know, I know... I'm working on it), so was curious how much you'd get for a rice bowl at this price. Well sir(or ma'am), you get a lot!I will be back many times to try everything else.",2,83,39,72,0

Within that millisecond the consciousness of the universe beheld itself to me and I recognized I'd be carrying that karmic debt for at least 3 days (possible 3 lifetimes ) if I chose to eat the dine in burrito. So I pointed to the table and said, ""that must be hers. I got a to-go order.""  The archangel Gabriel nodded to me and flew off. That woman looked so relieved and happy to be given the plate. Moments later my chicken kimchi burrito arrived. I paid for the item. They put it in a cute to-go bag. I brought that shit home and crushed it.

Every bite is filled with an immense amount of flavor that will get you hooked! Not only that but this place has an extensive drink selection from local beers to foreign sodas.

The seasoning on it was little light, but a touch of soy sauce from the dumplings complimented it well.

However, today their food was below average and service has become very bad as of recent. The owner who takes orders is a very angry and aggressive person who should not be in the service industry. I witnessed her unfriendly attitude with several customers. She even went as far as to scold kids on another table while they were eating, the family did not know how to respond to her. The staff wanted to call her out on her behavior but she obviously has a temper and they want to keep their jobs. She keeps reminding everyone when she has a chance- ""I am the owner"". Ambience is lacking (you are basically sitting in a gas station) which if the food was better maybe one could ignore that fact. Im never coming back again.

""Be with you in a moment"" would have been more than sufficient, that's the professional and courteous thing to do- and that's in any business! None of the items were priced, which is very annoying. I was there having a late lunch with my husband- he had a gyro and I had the stir fry, also we each got a side, some chips and a drink... the total came to $61 and some change. I asked for an itemized receipt and then the guy rang it all up again. The new total, $47 and change. This guy was not at all friendly or welcoming- I had previously asked him a question about a menu item, he mumbled something and was anything but helpful. All I could think is that he really didn't want to be at work or maybe he was just unhappy working there at all! I mean zero personality- no ""hello"" ""welcome"" ""thank you"" or ANYTHING. When asking again about an itemized receipt, he said he could write it all out for me. Really?! Like I would've done that to the two people waiting in line behind us. Never! I did, however, state that it would be nice if all of the items were priced. He defensively responded and stated ""this is my mother-in-laws place, a family owned business."" I thought ok, and?!? Honestly, what the hell does that have to do with anything? There are plenty of family owned businesses that price their items!! Is it really that hard to get a sharpie and write the price on the item? Or to make a sign?

Someone pointed me to the direction of the cafe, who was sort of indifferent or in conversation with what looked like someone that also worked there, but the cafe itself was awesome. I got an off the menu summer salad with fresh blue berries, mandarin oranges, nuts and cheese and added chicken to it. It was cooked perfectly and went along great with a balsamic vinaigrette. My server, Sami, was super nice and made great suggestions, like the unsweetened raspberry tea they have, which was amazing, and their signature coconut cake that the owner makes. I had both, and with no regret! The cake was huge so I took the rest home. They have great spacious seating and even a mini patio outside thats gated/gardened and it looks super cute.

I've had the Jerk Pork slider and the mushroom Swiss before and the pork was especially amazing. However, today it was completely different and was not delectable at all. On top of that, the mushroom and Swiss was slightly underdone, but tolerable. Mushrooms were tasteless.However, upon biting into the Lowrider, not only did it just taste absolutely terrible, but the chicken inside was still pink. I thought perhaps that my taste buds were just not agreeing with it, but my husband tried it and also said it tasted horrible.

I love the extensive slider choices and that you can mix and match most for $10.99. I ordered the Original, Buffalo chicken, Chick fill ay, BLT, This pork is not a jerk and Vegan. I didn't get to try the chick fill ay one but of the rest, my favorite was the buffalo chicken. It was marinated  before being fried and you could definitely tell the chicken had been loved on because it was succulent and tender. My least 2 favorite were the vegan and the BLT. The BLT bacon wasn't crispy and I just felt like it wasn't substantial enough and there were no crunchy toppings to offset the soft bun and vegan patty texture.They do offer a discount for teachers so I was pleased with that. I will go back again to try more of the sliders though and I will most definitely get the buffalo chicken one again. The price was fair so that was a plus.Check out my profile!",4,6,41,261,1

She gave little mini slushy cups to try before we ordered one. It wasn't my cup of tea but my gf loved it. It's definitely refreshing but too much ginger is a no go for me. I had the double slider added mushrooms and a cup of lobster bisque. Everything looked super tasty when it came out. The slider was fine, seasoned and I had no real complaints. But it didn't blow me away. However, it's a burger so what all do you really expect. Now the lobster bisque is where they really lost me.

We got the bibimbap with beef, and the spicy pork bulgogi. The bibimbap was underwhelming, quite bland, and extremely little meat.

Decide to his this spot up which lies on Highland strip not too far from the college.  The place itself is a bit hipster in design and atmosphere. Tables were all lined up against one wall in what looks like it was an old garage that was repurposed. (Has a garage door) I suppose it could be cool if you throw an event that would flow the crowd in and out.Ok about the food.... not your standard BBQ joint.  While there are options I found them a little limited. If you do choose to cook your own you get a propane fired camp grill brought to your table with a hot plate that you would cook on.We chose the Mandu appetizer. I was good but I have yet to find some that match or are as good as the street vendors when I lived in Korea.We also got the japchae as an appetizer.  This was pretty good and I would recommend it. Seasoning was good but just a tad on the oily side.For the main courses I chose soondubu with beef.  I liked it.

Small plate of kimchi cabbage and a small one of zucchini.  In all of the other places I've been to and I've been to a few there are far more offerings and variety brought to the table.. no fish cake, no radish both sweet and pickled..I found the wait staff underwhelming and had to wait quite a while to get your glass refilled.Still I'd hit this place up again but would not put it in my top Korean BBQ places.",0,39,115,56,0

Except upon closer inspection it was not actually cheese, no ....it was mashed potato. I was perplexed, I have never seen a mashed potato taco before,how could this possibly be good? But I soldiered on and took a bite. Friends, hear me when I say that I'm 39 years old and this was quite possibly the best bite of food I've ever taken.  I can't correctly describe it, except to say it was a lot like KFC mashies in a taco, only 11 billion times better. Once my mind got over the flavor burst it processed the crunch of the freshly fried corn tortilla and wow!!!! The avocado taco was good. It had a red onion slaw and some mango sauce. At first the mango sauce was a sweet tasty addition that slowly turned into a murderous fire hot assault on my tongue.  I prepares for the worse as I finished it, but strangely it was only that one bite that was hell fire in my mouth. After that the plain bean taco we not remarkable.  Their fresh made house sauces were delicious. I would eat here many many more times. The staff was very friendly and accommodating or my vegan lifestyle. Their rice and beans were stellar. They had upstairs seating and every other table was blocked off for COVID.

Gets Maciel of approval! And then some!I almost skipped this place. I mean I didn't really think that Mexican food in a city that doesn't really have very many Mexican people in a place that clearly is partially catering to hipster culture, could possibly be really good. I didn't think it would be authentic either - and no it's not prejudiced for me to prefer actual authentic food rather than fake hipster inventions (and that goes for every cuisine) - but the menu seemed to suggest that there was some authenticity going on, so I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try, since it was open on indigenous peoples day.The first thing that struck me was how incredibly friendly the owner guy is. He's like really wonderful. Really helpful. He loves all the questions you might have. He answers them directly and clearly. He'll tell you what his favorite stuff is and what the best stuff is and really he's the model of what an owner should be. And then there are all the cute girls working here. Who are genuinely friendly and warm and helpful and you just feel like you're with family. It's a great place to be.So yes I would probably get five stars just for the service, except guess what... The food is even better than the service. In fact, I'm amazed to say that this is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. He had no problem with the fact that I would be only getting two tacos and he recommend that I tried Chorizo from the regular menu and then a Chipotle Shrimp from the fish menu.I didn't expect either one to be good. Let alone great. Let alone the best taco on the planet. But he was very enthusiastic about them indeed so that gave me some hope. I thought they were little over priced at $3 to $4. Then they showed up and they had twice as much meat and filling as most other tacos I've ever gotten, so they're actually in line with great value tacos nationwide. And they came with three separate Salsas - all of which were cold and fresh and delicious. Amazingly, they even have a smoky dark pepper sauce like some Nuevo Laredo Style.So I popped these babies in my mouth and I have to say they were both perfection - orgasmic bliss. They were both so wet and juicy. But in totally different ways.The chorizo was heavy and hearty and crazy and spicy but so so so flavourful and I can honestly say it may be the best chorizo taco I've ever had and I love those things.The Chipotle Shrimp taco was a little bit of a variation on a theme and probably not what you would get in Mexico - but my goodness he's done it brilliantly. Proof that innovation is fine with me if it's done well. It just almost always isn't. I don't mind changing traditional dishes and adapting traditional menus if you're going to improve them or give alternative but equally awesome options.So - this is actually one of the best fish tacos I've ever had in my life. It's probably better than the Gubernador that was served down in San Diego that I've been raving about 4 years.So... best service. Decent prices. Enormous portions. And most importantly some of the best Mexican food especially the Chorizo and the Camarones Chipotle that you will ever eat in your life. I will literally be back in here every single time I come to Memphis. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu because if the stuff I've tried is that good then God knows what they can do with the rest of their products, and tortas for that matter.Hidden Gem is putting it mildly. Not that hidden on the Memphis scene but still very underrated. Best food in Memphis is obvious, although some of the BBQ spots share that title. Best food in the state of Tennessee? I would say so.Remember to use napkins... otherwise it could get a little Maci.",0,0,88,1,0

Due to COVID, obviously less people are eating out, so last week I jumped on the website and made a table reservation for me and a few friends. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the doors and asked to apply the provided hand sanitizer to our hands. We then were led to our table, which was far from other tables and the seats were appropriately spread out. Our waitress Kiara was AMAZING and so attentive! She was so sweet and was very careful when taking our orders, bringing us our food and extra utensils, and then when paying at the end. She made sure we were all comfortable and went above and beyond to be as careful and intentional as possible when following the restaurant's COVID guidelines! Not only was the service incredible, but the food was out of this world. Mac & Cheese is one of my favorite foods, so the Muddy Water Mac & Cheese hands down is some of my favorite I have ever had in my life. No one at our table was disappointed with their food and we all left stuffed to the brim! *Disclaimer: if you eat more on the healthier side, this may not be the best place for you.

But I couldn't care less because the food is really good. Since helping my boyfriend move down to Memphis, we've complained that we haven't had a single delicious meal at a restaurant in Memphis. That all changed when we came to Chef Tam's. We decided to come here because of a Groupon promotion and the good reviews on Yelp.We arrived at around 6pm on a Thursday. The place was packed, and the only seating left was at a large communal table (loved it - I'm personally a huge fan of communal tables at restaurants).We ordered the deep fried ribs, New Orleans (pontchartrain) catfish shrimp & grits, muddy water mac and cheese, southern greens, bacon cheddar gratin potatoes, candied yams, cornbread, and honey butter rolls.Everything was so. damn. delicious. So delicious that I'm swearing in this review. I'm not even sure if Yelp filters out swearing. The ribs had such a nice texture and were so well seasoned. I would've eaten all of it if my boyfriend weren't such a hog... and also if I didn't have another entree waiting for me. I ordered the New Orleans catfish shrimp & grits even though it didn't look or sound all that great to me - it was honestly the raving Yelp reviews for the pontchartrain catfish that convinced me to order it. Well those reviews were right. This dish was so good - I can't remember anything particular about taste or texture. It was just good. Really good. The cornbread was my favorite side; I loved the kernels of corn inside. The muddy water mac and cheese and cheddar gratin potatoes also have great flavor to them. Just be sure to order these ASAP because they run out quickly. I could probably do without the southern greens, candied yams, or honey butter rolls, which didn't really stand out.All in all, the food is delicious and worth coming back to. I'll be back in Memphis in a few weeks, and I'm already planning which entrees to get next with my boyfriend when we visit again.",2,263,22,27,0

The free delivery is what attracted me to the restaurant - you don't find many places right now with free delivery options. So, I ordered some breakfast to be delivered, and next thing I know, I'm ordering from them twice a week! Their food is so fresh and delicious!Things I would recommend:Breakfast: Classy Acai Bowl - acai bowl with bananas, blueberries, strawberries, and granola. Sometimes acai bowls don't fill me up, but this one is very filling and so good!Lunch/Dinner: Buffalo Tempeh + Sesame Cauliflower Hearty Bowl - this is just a unique combination of flavors - cauliflower, sweet potatoes, corn, buffalo sauce, and more. It's definitely got a little kick to it too. And the best thing about all their bowls is that you can add protein and make any of them into a wrap. The wraps come with a small side salad as well. Drinks: Freshen Up Kombucha - pineapple and mint mixed with their local kombucha. So good!You can't go wrong here. Also, their menu is so extensive - they have smoothies, wellness elixirs, breakfast all day, etc. There are so many options for you to pick from for all meals of the day.

First, let me say that our server Kylie was phenomenal! Every employee that we interacted with were friendly and thorough and made our experience amazing.

She had the crab soup which was the special and it was equally delicious!Oysters were great-- I was tempted to order another round :) We didn't want to eat too much so naturally we ordered the surf & turf and the sea bass. :-P Holy moly, I'm going to think about this meal for a while. Perfect portion to share, we left full, but not stuffed which is always the goal. The lobster was buttery and yum and the steak was cooked to perfection. The sea bass, ay ay ayeee truly amazing. I'm running out of adjectives. Both dishes were served with different types of potatoes, both to die for. And don't get me started on whatever sauce came with that sea bass.I live in California, so I'm devastated I won't be able to eat here anytime soon. Hoping there's a location closer to me :) Very happy we stopped by. Ambience, service, food, portion, prices... Everything was perfect. Thank you so much for everything.

We started with the beef Wellington, flaky and delicious. Also tried the deviled eggs topped with a fried oyster and bacon marmalade. Bacon marmalade! I don't even like bacon but couldn't stop eating this tasty treat. The strawberry caprese salad was nice, if the strawberries weren't quite ripe enough. The soups were divine. There was a cheddar poblano corn soup to die for. The lobster bisque was equally good. The gumbo was... wrong.  As a Louisiana girl, it was just not right,maybe an abundance of oregano? I couldn't tell. It was just wrong. We went with the fish flight and shared it. All three were great. I'd say my favorite was the grouper with coconut and mango rice. Second favorite was the sea bass with potatoes and bacon. Yum. And the least favorite was the redfish. A bit bland but the rice was good. For dessert we loved the chocolate chip cookie. Also good was the blueberry strudel. The pineapple upside down cake was th least favorite but the coconut gelato was the bomb. Our server was perfect. Friendly without being overly hovering.

However, turns out they do offer a veg option, you just have to ask for it! I was recently visiting Memphis to celebrate a special occasion and this seemed like the place to go. Some of the salads are veg:  we split the strawberry and mozzarella salad which was good. The veg entree was mushroom ravioli, ratatouille and grilled veggies with a potato croquette. It was fine, nothing special or particularly tasty -- but to be fair to Flight, vegetarian dishes are not supposed to be their speciality. I enjoyed my Sauvignon blanc wine flight and the dessert flight was really fun and pretty good. Service was excellent and I thought prices were fair.

As a light eater, I liked the idea of being able to get smaller servings, plus getting to try more entrees! You can get a flight of three entrees (they've pre-created flights for you, but you can mix it up). If you don't want to do three entrees, you can get a more ""dinner sized"" portion of one entrée if you want. My boyfriend got a flight that included wild boar, surf and turf, and short ribs - each ""small"" plate had quite a healthy portion on it, including a side dish like potatoes. I got the strawberry caprese salad to start (and you can order a small plate size or a regular salad size) which was absolutely incredible. I then went with lobster benedict which was delicious when I finally got it (apparently they dropped mine as they left the kitchen and had to remake it, so I had to sit and watch the boyfriend eat his dinner, then he got to sit and watch me eat when it finally came out which was a bummer). We were so full we couldn't eat any more, but they very graciously wrapped up a flight of desserts for us to go and we got to eat them later - yum. It was a quiet, classy setting (we were in the wine cellar) and very nice for a special dinner out. One tip - apparently apple maps has a hard time finding their location (it had us way in a different area) - so ask for directions or use google maps. It is located on a pedestrian street/walkway which also makes for a little more complication. We weren't sure how dressy it was, but we were in business casual type clothes and that was fine. Some were more dressed up, others more casual, so it's really up to you.",0,80,316,182,1

I had the Farm & Field which is Quail with Andouille Cornbread Stuffing, Lamb Rib Eye with a Loaded Potato Croquette and Chicken & Waffles with a Mushroom Cream Sauce.

The ambiance is what you'd expect out of the low-budget Honky Tonks of Nashville, with the same attitude being extended behind the bar - as Ole Smoky Moonshine is about the best you're gonna get. But the disappointment of the liquor selection was quickly drowned out by tunes of Dolly and Garth, admittedly hard to find in mainstays of the 901, and I found myself tapping my foot in rhythm as time passed. After a very drawn-out wait that left several patrons at the bar asking,   ""What's taking so long?"" The bartender mumbled something about eggs creating a kitchen backlog as they only have four cast iron skillets, and I damn near heard my Aunt (God rest her soul) chuckle from Heaven. That woman only needed two cast irons to keep the eggs, the biscuits and the bacon in never-ending service to her eight kids. But I digress...""Low Country"" cooking is what the menu claimed, but I've never paid upwards of $20 for a bowl of grits in my neck of the woods. Of course I hail from the Heart of Dixie and not some uppity Carolinas like the owners do, so probably just not my cup of tea. In the Deep South, $20 could feed a family, we'd have had a heartfelt conversation with the owners themselves, and blueberry biscuits wouldn't dare be served with raw dough in the center. This restaurant being independently owned has the makings for much more, and would be deserving of the price tag with a few minor touches: a warm and welcoming staff, quality sourced meats from local farms, and a little bit of elbow grease to kill them drain flys that kept creeping up. The sweetness of Southern hospitality can't be imitated, or branded by the name of ""Sugar."" Especially when you serve watered down jam. Bless their heart.Ultimately, this place will have the appeal of downtown tourists, I'm sure, but ""Low Country"" isn't a branded term of endearment - but a way of both living and eating to those who call the South home.Sugar Grits makes you want to cuss your MeMaw, no - not because it's that good. Rather, as any true southerner knows, a good cussin' would be promptly followed with a bar of Lye soap to the mouth, and well, that's exactly what you'll need after this meal.",0,151,17,1,0

Not as tasty as the jumbo filet of fried catfish I soon was presented with, however. Sometimes I want seasoned breading and sometimes I don't. They season their batter well and I loved it. The greens were just as I like: not heavily seasoned with country ham or some other meat. I want my greens to have their own flavor stand out and these did.

The mac and cheese was excellent, and the green beans were good. Definitely worth a visit.That being said, however, I hope they make it.There are several factors going against it:1. Cooking to order at lunch. Yes, it was excellent. But, there are too many meat & 2 places around where you don't have to wait, and for many of us, we simply do not have the time.2. Price - a $10 lunch is too expensive. Yes, great food, but who can afford to pay that price when other places - ie, Barksdale's is $3 less? 3. Parking - I see Lauren C's comment about parking.

The worst is when restaurants just have a vat of plain fried rice that they heat up and add plain shrimp after the fact.  So, the rice is a bit hard, lacks good flavor- there is an onion here/there, but you'd never know to taste it.  The shrimp are plain, flavorless and colorless, definitely not cooked with the rice.  I like the fried rice with eggs, bean sprouts, scallion, and, well, some heart--this just is not it.That being said, there is something about the place that makes me want to go try something else.  The menu is intriguing, with some curry dishes and then some cheesy american eats.  Ill keep u posted...",0,34,55,78,0

If you put a red pepper next to a menu item it should be at least medium spicy. This dish had just a hint of spice, which is better than most Asian restaurants these days. Unfortunately the trend in Asian restaurants is to have almost no spice in dishes that are supposed to be spicy. Szechuan, anything in garlic sauce, Kung Pow, and General Tzo's chicken Are all supposed to be spicy. If you don't like spicy food don't order these dishes and then complain about it being too hot.

My wife and I, just married and on our honeymoon, drove across Memphis to get to this location because the pictures online of the food and drinks looked amazing. We arrived and had only a short time to wait before getting seated. We sat outside on a beautiful day, we ordered and promptly received our food. I ordered the Key Lime Pie cocktail, and as a born and raised Floridian I was pleasantly surprised as most ""key lime pie"" flavors from most places outside of southern Florida just don't taste right, my wife ordered the Vodka Sunrise and said it was delicious. Never in my life have I had pancakes as delectable and tender as the one's I've eaten here and my wife is a sucker for French toast, she also loved them. The staff was so friendly and nice. They even took pictures of us for our honeymoon and put so much effort into it. We will definitely be coming back! - Kyle & Skylar",4,0,2,8,0

For starts it was a Wednesday morning and the place had about half a dozen tables occupied when we arrived, and the place was pretty dirty. The restaurant itself was super cute upon first glance.. but once we sat down we realized how dirty the floors were and our table had a weird tacky feel to the top..We ordered a burrito bowl, cinnamon roll pancakes, an adult hot chocolate, and a brunch margarita with orange juice-the burrito bowl came out within 5 mins of ordering it.. before we got drinks or our pancakes- which was kind of strange that it wasn't planned a bit better so our food came out together vs sitting there waiting for the other half. The bowl itself was not great... the onions and peppers tasted like they hadn't been cooked at all- and the eggs (supposed to be scrambled) seemed like they were cooked on a grill that was too hot.. so my bowl had big chunks of overcooked egg. The sausage was hard and either had been sitting for a while or was over cooked.. the entire thing was covered in cheese (which made it partially edible) and some watery fresh pico/salsa mix- which made the entire thing very runny and weird... I think that should be served on the side. The cinnamon roll pancakes were delicious and HUGE which worked out since the bowl I ordered wasn't worth finishing.. our drinks were really good, but the lady behind the bar had a really crummy attitude and we heard her cussing about call in orders or something else going on while we were there, which we thought was pretty unprofessional.. overall I wouldn't have gone out of our way to eat here- but if you are in the neighborhood it would be worth dropping in for some cinnamon roll pancakes!",2,262,108,291,1

My friends and I came around 10:30am and were told it would be a 1 hour and 15 minute wait. Obviously we were thrilled but were willing to wait since we expected a bit of a wait anyway. We joined the waitlist and I got a text on my phone saying we were in line and would get a text when our table was ready. Since it was a warm day, we decided to shop around in stores with AC while we wait. Finally, after an hour and 15 minute wait, I got a text and we hurried over to get seated. Right in front of us, we saw a group of people who seemed to be seated right away without a wait. Funky, considering we were just told the wait was an hour and 15 minutes? Then, the hostess acted oddly when I told her our name. We were told that they accidentally notified us and our table was indeed not ready. We waited for 15 more minutes, then asked how long it would take to get a table. They said 5-15minutes. Considering we had already when waiting for 1 hour and 30 minutes, and seeing all the people get seated right as they showed up, we weren't willing to wait any longer. How could we trust it wouldn't be longer than a 15 minute wait, since clearly the initial wait time we were told was a lie? We just left without eating there, with 1 and a half hours of our time wasted, hungry, and upset at the way we were treated. It was clear to us that they forgot about us on the list, and who knows if they were even using it. Through all this, we didn't receive a single explanation or apology and were just told we weren't supposed to be notified. I really was excited for this place, but no food is worth the disrespect we have received from here. I will be eating elsewhere for brunch from now on.",3,260,79,161,1

Not only was the food amazing but so were the staff.  It was limited seating during covid.  They had a huge poster of rules that I'll attach.  Coming from California where the rules are very different, it felt safer with their rules.  The moment we walked in the door we were engaged in conversation with the staff.  They took our temperature and we were able to take our masks off at the table, but the staff always wore their mask.  You can tell the staff was happy for us to be there and appreciated our business.  They were extremely nice and we enjoyed talking to our waiter Adam and the head chef came out as well.  I liked what they did with the silverware, that instead of putting forks and knives straight on the table, they were in small protective bags that only we touched to take out of the bag.  Overall it was amazing.  My boyfriend wouldn't stop talking about it the rest of the night.  Wish this place was in my town!",2,0,24,2,0

The perfect combination, meatloaf, garlic mashed potatoes, and some green beans, took some home cooking and turned into an exquisite meal. The scallops? Oh man, I'm not a scallop kind of guy, but wow. The lovely lady is a seafood enthusiast, and even she couldn't believe how well cooked they were. I won't speak for her tastebuds, but my own were living the dream. Presentation was great, everything was very well put together, a work of art that I was hesitant to disturb, but sure glad I did.

Upon entry, our temperature was taken and we were seated at our table. I ordered the soup or the day (a lobster bisque) and the daily special (which was a cowboy rubbed steak with mashed potatoes and green beans). I was enticed by the chorizo meatloaf (and if I'm back in Memphis, that's next on my list). The food was delicious -- I have no negative comments about it. The spice rub came through beautifully on the steak, while the bisque was creamy and also had chunks of meat (which is not always common). We also ordered the goat grit and grind ball, which is an ingenious concept -- while I felt the goat cheese could have been a bit warmer, it certainly did not detract from the overall quality of the dish.Preventing a 5-star rating were the drinks. I got the El Diablo, but my main issue is that there was too much ice in the drink for such a small glass. So it was hard to taste the drink without getting ice with every sip, and also the ice watered the down drink very fast.",0,2,8,2,0

Good ones are hard to find especially in Memphis.

I love the lemongrass tofu as well as the salted tofu w/ jalapenos. If you're looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant w/ing Memphis proper (not counting the ones in the suburbs), this is probably the best. PRO TIP: 1) Before people start ranting about bad service... if you go at lunchtime during the week, they are PACKED!!! I believe there are only 2 people in the kitchen and maybe 2 or 3 other servers. They get super overwhelmed, so if you have a large group (6+)...THEY WILL MESS SOMETHING UP. Sometimes I just order to go, if I can. If you MUST come here for lunch...get there early like 11:30. If you get here at 12 or 12:30, you will end up waiting forever. 2) I'm almost certain only one of them can speak English well, so sometimes it might just be easier to give them the dish number. Try to not have a complicated order if possible or you and the server will both be irritated. :-p3) If you have a bad experience the first time...please give them another shot.",1,103,5,4,0

I'll be back to try the pork chop, but today's visit was all about the Pho. Place had plenty of seating, I was greeted and handed a menu immediately along with a glass of water. Waitress was cordial but all business. No problem there. I ordered the Pho Dac Biet with flank, meatball, tendon and tripe, and a spring roll to start. Spring roll (Sprimp) came out immediately and was your standard good version. The Pho came out within 5 minutes afterward, with a standard ""salad"" plate of herbs, sprouts, and lime. First look and I noted the broth was a bit oily. I don't mind a bit of oil on my bowl, but I do like some to be skimmed off during the cook. This was a bit more than I like.... something to note if you're averse to it as well. Aroma was good. Flavor was good but something was a bit off. Between the color and the flavor, I wonder if they don't have a dedicated beef Pho broth, but instead work in some sort of poultry elements. I could be wrong but there are flavors there I'm not used to. Not bad, just not quite a ""traditional"" beef pho broth. Still quite good, though. EDIT: looking at other photos it appears they may have given me a chicken pho broth with my beef pho... which kinda sucks but would explain the flavor. Dropping to 3 stars for that mixup. The meats were suitable in quality and quantity. The tendon and tripe were a bit chunkier cut (lending themselves to be a bit more chewy than usual), and the sliced beef was a bit fatty. Not bad but worth noting. Overall, I like the place and will be back. I would call it an above average bowl in town here.",4,173,139,350,0

Except for the soups. They are more of a liquid. That's just a lame joke. The place is nice and clean. Great artwork murals on the walls. The price seems fair. This is my first visit here. I've been a long time loyal customer to my favorite place in the whole world, so I've never had reason to come here. I shall never again experience the great food I've had so many times down the road because the Memphis fire department failed to save what was once such a great restaurant. Saigon Le, how I so dearly miss you. I will mourn for you for years to come. I only hope there's some worthy substitute who can provide me with only a fraction of what I experienced there and came to love.Phuong Long, how I hope you can fill this void I have. From my one meal here, I do believe you are worthy, but you don't have what they did. Maybe it's unfair at this point to compare you to someone else. After all, you didn't ask for the fire, you didn't ask to be compared to anyone else, you didn't ask to be held to such a high standard, and you certainly didn't ask to gain me as a customer or a pseudo food critic. It seems as though this is exactly the position we are in, and I will hold you to a higher standard than the average restaurant. To comment on your menu and your food, I'll start by saying I am uneducated about it and for the most part, and I don't know what I'm talking about. The language barriers we share make it difficult to ask for assistance. I don't know what to order or how to ask for it. Down the street, I just used guessing as my technique for ordering, and I would remember the things I liked the most. I liked everything they served me, but some were better than others. I don't know your menu yet, and either I will have to try to do some research, or I'll just resort to guessing. It will take some time to adjust to this life-altering change, but I'll have to move on with my life and learn to love it. Maybe it will work out to be a good thing!! At first glance, your lunch menu doesn't offer the options I was hoping for. The entree, egg roll, rice, and soup. I think the soup was missing from yours. I should have asked for a carry out menu so I could do some studying. I simply chose to go with a soup and it didn't disappoint. I'm not familiar enough with pho to make a good decision, so I ordered the combination with everything. I was very satisfied with how huge your bowl was, and I finished the entire thing. The broth was wonderful. I didn't really know what tripe was until I read a little Wikipedia, and it sounds kinda gross. I didn't care much for the tripe either, but ate it none the less. Everything else in that pho was outstanding. I loved the meatballs. I liked the beef and chicken. The vegetables were great. I made mine super hot with that sriracha. The flavors blended wonderfully and I enjoyed every bite. I was very impressed. As for the building, it is large, new, and clean. It must have undergone a major transformation and I was comfortable being there. The service was what I would expect. I chose something quickly and ordered it by number. I do think an English speaking American would have difficulty asking questions. Phuong Long, I hope we can find a way to establish a great relationship, but I will always have heightened expectations. I debated about giving you 5 stars, but in this case, I want more from you before you earn it. That will make your 5 star rating more deserving.",1,236,636,4487,1

What I should've done was get the chips. I read (before typing this) that the chips are local, which is something I enjoy, local things to see what they have to offer out of the norm. Outside of that, great burgers to choose from. You can choose your patties between ground beef, ground turkey & chipotle black bean. The prices are around $10 & the service I had was good (especially with my waitress having to deal with a party of 6 tables). I recommend for those who are from out of town to put this place on your list. Right along the strip of Midtown.",0,17,3,0,0

Was light, airy, and fluffy on the inside with a nice crust on top. Also well seasoned with herbs and ParmesanKale salad: flavors were on point. All salad ingredients complimented each other well. My only recommendation is that the kale should be wilted a little by either roasting or a quick sauté bc it was very fibrous rawPolenta with duck confit: this is a good combination. A bit on the salty side. Also it's super rich. Kale radiatore: house made pasta. Perfect pairing with the lemon sauce and tomatoes. This was the favorite dish of the night.

The sauce is a sofrito chicken liver sauce but I did not taste much in the way of liver which usually has a mineral metallic taste but it was well hidden.

A friend and I went there on a Wednesday night and sat out on their newly updated patio.First of all, their COVID procedures were the best I've seen in any restaurants since reopening began. They take your temperature when you walk in. You are also required to wear a mask when you walk through the restaurant (but can remove it once you sit at your table). Tables are spread out both inside and outside. Finally, they are not giving out paper menus - but instead they have a small postcard with several QR codes to see the drink menu, dinner menu, and dessert menu on your phone. I felt very comfortable dining here.As for the food - AMAZING! For appetizers, we got the Arancini and the Royal Red Shrimp. The Arancini was one giant fried ball filled with Bolognese and spring peas. Highly recommend!! The shrimp were three pieces of fried shrimp with a dipping sauce. Both appetizers were good to split with just two people, but I wouldn't recommend any more people to share than that. For the main course, I got the Rigatoni and you MUST get this!!! The pasta was mixed with this wonderfully smoky pork belly. I could eat that dish every night!Atmosphere and service were great as well! I recommend to sit outside if you can because they just put in a new pergola with lights. Recommend right now to call and make a reservation if you are going since there are limited tables.

The appetizers were very good - meatballs, fried cheese, pork belly, and bruschetta. I had the pork belly and bruschetta and they were a great start. Our party was outside in the back at this time by the fireplace and it was very nice. The servers were courteous and hustled. For the pasta course, they served ""Maw Maw's"" ravioli, a smoked ricotta dish called mafalde, and potato gnocchi dish. They were also very good. The flavors all went well together and nothing was too heavy. The entree course included two items: pork and halibut. I can not describe how good these were. What really stood out was how the vegetables, herbs, and other sides complemented the meat and fish. The sauces, potatoes, peas, beans, kale, etc. really set the foods apart. Great creations for sure. The final course was dessert. They served butter cake and cheesecake. Both were very good as well.

When you walk in, you feel like you're walking into a home, which adds to the experience of eating something true to their home style rather than focusing on fancy facades. I can't speak to the service in the small dining room spaces, which look elegant, since I always go straight to the back and sit at the bar. They have a decent selection of whiskeys and cocktails and full service at the bar. The menu is a collection of charcuterie, fine cheeses, anti pastas and mains as you'd expect with a typical Italian style menu. Their revolving selection and fresh ingredients definitely make their selections sing. My favorite on their menu has always been their octopus, which is a nicely cooked tentacle served on a cream sauce that is light and complimentary. Service is fantastic, staff is friendly and food is wonderful.

You can go the entree way but I opted for the tapa style, ordering a pasta and the bean soup. The bean soup was hearty and you could tell it was fresh. More of a chicken soup broth than I was expecting but couple the steamy broth with dipped bread and Parmesan and it was a hit. The main course for me was the gnocchi. I tried to spice the dish up by adding mushrooms but (1) there was an upcharge of $2, and (2) they deleted the chicken from the dish making it vegetarian.  So I ended up with a meatless pasta which was still phenomenal one with thick potato gnocchi and fresh veggies once again, but disappointing as gnocchi with chicken is a rarity. Cocktail game is on point. I had a port cocktail and a classic sazerac. Not cheap at about $12 a piece but strong and perfectly concocted. The service was off from the mushroom disco to taking 15 minutes to bring out menus to dragging the dinner out 1.5 hours unnecessarily.

I can go down the street to Huey's and get a bigger turkey patty on a regular burger for $7 so I don't see myself personally eating here too much. If you like specialty options, I can't speak on the flavor/quality, but they do have some good looking options. My favorite thing I found there was their family box and their party box. I'm hosting a christmas party and decided I would get very casual catering. Both of these boxes would be great for the occasion. One party box ($45) has 16 mini burgers. You get to choose 4 different types of burgers (every 4 burgers is one style so 4 beef burgers, 4 turkey etc.) With the family box ($35) you get 8 mini burgers, 8 wings, onion rings, and fries.

Just judging the food itself, I'm at three stars. The burgers just were not that great, especially for this price. They arrived at my seat at the bar within five minutes of being ordered, yet they were not even warm. It was if they were cooked prior to my arrival. I could not notice the difference between the two meats I'd selected. The meats were not juicy and they were kind of dry. Nothing at all to be proud of. I liked their take on the potato rings or what they call fries. The onion rings are average. Pretty sure they're both frozen. I like the concept. I give my fourth star to the orderability of the menu. There are lots of choices and the menu guides you through your decision process very efficiently and without confusion. My fifth star goes to the young man working the bar. I've had terrible service elsewhere this week, and this young man went above and beyond. He was patient and helpful while taking my order, but it was the ketchup ordeal that really made me walk away from here happy. As soon as I was served, I realized I had no ketchup. He pointed to where it was by the soda machine (I had missed it) and told me it was self serve, but in the same breath, he volunteered to get some for me. And away he went, returning with two cups of ketchup. If a manager is reading this, this act of kindness was most appreciated. We all know how much we hate walking across the room the very moment a plate is set down in front of us. Most places don't respect their customers the way I felt respected and appreciated here. When I left, I asked him if I was supposed to clean my mess, and he said it was no problem that he would get it. This service did not go unnoticed.

I honestly am not a burger person so I likely wouldn't have ever given this place a shot unless someone else brought me or something like this gave me free samples. While we were in line waiting for it to start some people came out and asked questions about the place and gave away prizes to those who knew the answers. A lady also came out with burger samples once they actually opened the doors. I am so glad I was so far back!! I got to try two different burgers from the ones they gave you inside! My friends were totes jelly and I am glad I got to try so many different flavors. The two burgers I got to try outside were the Wagyu and the Lamb. I didn't like the lamb but I don't really like lamb anyway. I would have liked the Wagyu if there was more sauce on it. It was just a plain burger up until I got to the end and got a ton of delicious sauce all on one part of it. I would try it again and ask for some extra sauce on the side. Once we got inside we were able to see how tiny the place is. They've made it fun by having a bar area, though. We got two more burgers, beef and chicken, and fries inside. I can't lie, three burgers and a few fries and I'm totally stuffed. Luckily, I loved the beef and hated the chicken- it tasted like something from a school cafeteria. I took one bite and put it back down. If they ever changed to grilled I would totes try it again but for now, nope! The beef had the perfect amount of sauce and was just plain fantastic. It'd be fun to add some cool new toppings next time once I find out which bases I like. They have some fun stuff like eggs, jalapenos, and stuff like that. I'm not a burger connoisseur so I probably wouldn't know what I was doing but I'd totes try! Every sandwich automatically comes with tomato, lettuce, onion, and sauce. You can request extra sauce but make sure to check that they do it- I am pretty sure they left it off my last order.

There is also a variety of seating options - there's 4 booths, 2 tables and then a U shaped bar with around 20 stools. Staff were super friendly! Also I'm not a soda kinda gal, but if you are, the options in the soda machine are massive but I think they may need another machine as the line here moved slowly with folks wanting to see all the flavors (yes, I'm guilty of doing it too - apology to the folks in line behind).I'm delaying talking about the food cause I really wanted to like it, but honestly I didn't. The seasoning on my chicken just lacked flavour - it was okay but nothing I'd want to return for. I did sorta like my fries - they were different, but lacked salt and also too oily.

I left a comment on the Web page and was called back by the general manager Sunday morning. He started to chastise me telling me how much money he loses when he keeps the store open with no business. I suggested it might be his store because everything else in the area was busy. The Highland Strip always does great business and people are there eating all the time. If he can't get customers on a Saturday he needs to strategize. At this point he claimed his phone cut out so I said good bye.  He called back and I declined. The manager left a message telling me I hung up. I deleted it without listening further.If I want a good burger I'll go to R.P. Track's. It's less expensive and less hassle.,0,0,15,7,0

Always be sure to try a new place, before returning back to somewhere we've been. Well tonight was my choice, and I seen the reviews and how interesting the food was!!! The appetizers we chose were amazing. The loaded fries and the Buffalo nachos were great! Where it took a turn for the worst was the salad and the main course! I normally take my phone with me but tonight we had a rule no phones at dinner! So no damn photos of the food.Our salads one Caesar and two house were lack luster, the two house salads were with wilted greens. Which we ended up not even eating but 2-3 bites before the main course came out and our salads taken away.My mother in law ordered the bacon filet as rare as possible! Which they got the temp correct and the it was very rare! However, to call a filet an actual filet... it is considered the tenderloin of beef! Not the most gristle filled extra hard, with the silver strip attached and a knife can barely cut through it!My husband ends up cutting off pieces and pushed what appeared to be about 2oz worth of inedible gristle. We waited patiently for our server Courtney who was accommodating and very friendly! We advised her of the issue, not once complaining or rude. We simply stated that she needed to show this to her manager so he could see that this is not what they claim was a filet. She walked away with the plate and we watched as she went to her manager Q! He not once came to speak with us, not once turned to even acknowledge us, he walked with her to the back while she held the plate! First off as a manager he should of grabbed the plate, and came straight to the table and apologized asked what recommendations or how he could better the issue! Nope! Instead our waitress come back and says, I am so sorry about that, he asked if you would like a dessert on the house! Hmmmm... nope! But thanks for the offer! Still no sign of the manager! She asks are you ready for your bill, okay no problem! We paid $94.77 and had no issue with paying this price! However, we asked if the manager would consider comping maybe $9 dollars of what we felt was fair for the so called filet that was all gristle! Our waitress then goes back and here comes the manager with a chip on his shoulder! First words he said was ""WHATS THE PROBLEM""!!! Your asking for a comp on a steak that you ate almost all of, and now your complaining it was horrible! (Mind you he didn't have the plate with the evidence on it).Hmmm.. total ass backwards if you ask me, your willing  to give a free dessert that was around the same price of a comp and yet we are paying $94.77 for a damn meal and you have that attitude!!! It was like talking to a brick wall, with no care in the world! Came out with a bully attitude and a piss poor excuse to be combative with a 70 year old woman! Long story short! If your looking for a bar with decent food, this may be the place you wanna come to! Be sure your 80% wasted so you don't notice your food! Don't even bother asking for a manager because it a HUGE JOKE! You are better off getting help from the security who watches the parking structure! For the price we paid tonight LONG HORNS or OUTBACK would of been a better deal! False advertisement of what they call a filet, it was road kill strips! Hanging on by strings!

I had to literally grab the waitress to ask is it seat yourself to which she replied ""uh huh"". So outside we went. And we waited. And waited. Until finally this bubbly personality appeared and took our orders. She made recommendations and I ordered the Red Head Bitch and my friend had something called Sex with an Alligator I believe. They have an extensive cocktail menu and she said the prices range from $11-$14. The small martinis look like about a 4oz glass. Too small. The jumbo martini turns out to be just a regular martini glass with supposedly 4oz of alcohol. I doubt it. My cocktail was decent but it wasn't worth $13.

If dining alone I promise you after a few martinis you will make a friend or two at the bar. They have amazing appetizers and it's hard to choose just one so I suggest getting a few different things to try. I personally love the Memphis Fries and the egg rolls. I'm a midtown girl so take out from Side Street was always a must for me and when I did I usually got their Philly cheese steak and fries...omg soooo good and very filling.

It's a cute spot downtown overlooking Main St that my friend noticed on a visit to a neighboring establishment. She asked me to join here here for dinner and cocktails earlier this week.The day we came, one server manned both the dining room and the patio. Although it wasn't very busy, I expected that there would be delays. This was fine as I enjoyed people watching and conversing with my friend on the patio. We ordered the lump crab fried green tomatoes and the calamari as appetizers. The fried green tomatoes were divine. They were fried to perfection and paired well with the crabmeat, diced sweet and tart green tomatoes that garnished the dish and their house sauce. The calamari; however, was lukewarm and much chewier than I am accustomed to. I'm not sure if this was a result of not using fresh ingredients or being overcooked. Im leaning toward the former. For my entree, I ordered the Voodoo Pasta and a cup of crawfish and corn chowder. My friend had the Delmonico Steak. The server said it was a cut of prime rib, but it was clearly a sirloin and as tough as shoe leather. It was accompanied by thick potatoes and broccoli, although the menu said broccolini. My pasta exuded blandness, severely lacking the flavor this is customary of a New Orleans themed dish. It was only slightly better after I requested Cajun seasoning to add to it. The chowder that I anticipated would be creamy and layered with aromatics and boldness was, in fact, also tasteless and chunky, but not in a good way. The consistency was goopy and tasted nothing of a any chowder I've had before. It was more like a wet hash. My friend paid her check, but I asked for a few more moments. After about 15 minutes had gone by, I went inside to pay the bill, where I saw one couple seated in the entire dining room and 1 person at the bar. The server was fully engaged in a conversation with him. I gave him the payment to run and he gave me the receipt to sign. When I asked for the detailed receipt, he printed it and all but flung it on the table in front of me. To say that the experience was disappointing is an understatement.

They could almost be considered a desert. Followed by that was the lobster salad. I asked our server if this portion was large enough to share for 2 as it was almost double the price (duh, it's lobster) of the other plates. She assured us it was and when we received it the portion was barely enough for one. It's absolutely incredible so I would order more than one if you have any lobster lovers at the table!

We sat at the bar area because the dining room was closed to additional quests. The food however needs work. Service: good. Our bartender was also good at crafting cocktails according to my husband. I had the white wine (Alleme) which was highly recommended but I found it to be rather flat and not very fruit forward as advertisedHouse rolls: this was a huge disappointment at $6 for only 2 small rolls. But I can handle the price if it was actually good but they were stale and worse than grocery store rolls. We took one bite and sent them back. Bakers they are not! Pig ears: my husband enjoyed these but I was not a fan so this will not impact the rating. But I want the readers to know what to expect. The texture of the pig ears is what you would expect, crunchy and a bit chewy bc of the cartilage. The flavoring is where they lost me. It's doused in buffalo sauce so it has a heavy vinegar taste. Served w ranch dressing Peel and eat shrimp: shrimp sizes are inconsistent ranging from Med to large. 5 shrimp to a serving. Beet salad: the beets were slightly undercooked but there was one beet that was actually bad. It was tough and had a woody taste. I think it must have been old. Served w yogurt sauce. Pumpkin: the pumpkin was perfectly cooked. It would have been great if it was just served by itself. The ham it was topped with was super dry and chewy. The real offense was the bath of butter it was served in. No one needs this much butter. I actually had to stop the server from adding more butter bc it is poured tableside Crab claws: the claws were super small like they killed some underside baby crabs. Again the real crime here was the amount of butter the crab was  served in. It's was crab in butter bath. See photos. Oysters: the oysters did not have much flavor. They actually tasted watery. No shucking skills as all of the oysters had bits of shell in it and 5 out of 6 of the oysters I had was still stuck to the shell. Their horseradish was also weak. It had an odd texture and was preserved in vinegar so it didn't taste like horseradish S'mores: best and only good thing we had all nice. Interesting deconstructed presentation. One of the better desserts I've had. In summary I would only come back here again for the s'mores dessert.",8,11,172,293,1

Being the super basic person that I am, my friends decided to take me to The Gray Canary. A few blocks away from the craziness of downtown, The Gray Canary overlooks the water and has this great industrial chic warehouse vibe, similar to what you would expect to see in Shoreditch, London. Although the portions here are tiny and the prices high by Memphis standards, we still managed to order tons of food and ended up pretty full. We shared the:-Murder Point Oysters: I'm used to oysters in Boston and preferred the gulf oysters here way more! They were smooth, and not briny at all, super tasty. We could've easily ordered another half dozen.-Parker House Rolls: Oh my gosh, so delicious! Soft, with this delightful buttery glaze. We gobbled these right up!-Brussels Sprouts: I love brussels sprouts, and I love bougie brussels sprouts (I did mention that I'm basic, right?). Thinly chopped brussels sprouts with pecorino and hazelnuts on top, yum!-Beets: Nicely coated with a good yogurt sauce to go with them. They were tasty, but not that special.-Potato Cake: Beautiful layers with a crispy outside and soft inside. The creme fraiche was a nice touch. That said, it was still just potatoes and if you have a crispy outside and soft inside, it's basically just bougie french fries. Which are delicious, especially if there's caviar on them.-Trout: This was delicious! The fish was beautifully cooked, and the sauce was artsy and delicious. Also loved the watercress on top. There were only 4 bites, and we all wanted more.-Lamb: They were well cooked, but had way too much lamb, gamey flavor for me so I only had a bite. Was happy to see more brussels sprouts on the plate though.-S'mores: Wow!!!!!! Just wow. You MUST try the S'mores!!! It's coated in a marshmallow meringue thing with frozen soft serve in the middle on top of a delicious graham cracker crust with hazelnut sauce and hazelnut sauce on the side to create the most incredible bite. So so so amazing!! It's one of the desserts I'm going to dream about forever. So much yum!Service was great.

Sitting at the bar by the kitchen for the optimal experience definitely helps, but the rest is simply dimly lit.

In terms of atmosphere style and food this place is venerable. I read that the team behind it had helmed some other good restaurants in the area which didn't surprise me. I easily made a reservation on Resy and I'm glad I did because the place filled up quickly. I enjoyed about 5 small plates and 1 main. The two most memorable dishes I had were the trout and the mussels. The trout sits on top a classic french soup and I wish I had the recipe. It might be the best thing I've eaten in 5 years. Make sure you put this spot on a visit to Memphis it's very special. The only mistake I made was the pork tenderloin which was too salty with its apple brine.

The food menu changes monthly/periodically, but we tried their rolls, fried snapper, and a cold squid salad dish. The rolls were really delicious and buttery. The squid dish reminded me a bit of a Thai papaya salad, and definitely had some Asian influence in the flavors. It was very tasty and refreshing to eat. The snapper was well cooked but had too strong of a dill flavor and its sides were bland. The food had its ups and downs- which is only expected for contemporary, fusion dishes. I would rate the food at Gray Canary at a 3/5 but the cocktails were a solid 5/5.

POINT.  Wow, I had enough food plus some and even had some left over to take home.The not so good though left me very confused...  When you think fixed menu, you think course by course, one at a time.  Not here though!  They brought out parsnips, pork, and manicotti for all three of us all at once.  Yes, we had six dishes on our table all at once, served all at once.  What's even odder is how taken aback the waiter was when we mentioned we were confused and asked exactly what was going on.  I'm fine with family style serving, but I don't need nor should I be served everything at once.  Like what?  Did I miss the memo here or something?  Craziness.The service in general was pretty lackluster to be honest.  Our waiter really didn't know the menu or cocktails and failed to explain anything about the menu or how it worked.  The restaurant closed at 9pm, and around 8:15pm, we essentially were pushed out of the place.  One of the waiters came and told us he was going to clear off some plates to get things wrapped up; note that these were plates with food still on them.  I'm sorry, come again?  I'm not a snob, but I'm pretty sure no one asked you to take our food away nor did you ask us.  It was extremely rude, and he persisted in that rudeness through the end of the night.I still can't get over the whole deal.  It was an experience I'm sure I'll laugh about from time to time when remembering, but I sure was seriously bewildered in the moment.",0,289,233,105,1

Seriously, why is everyone not adding these crispy pieces to their sandwiches? The bbq sauce was tangy perfection. The baked beans were incredible too. They had an overwhelming onion flavor, which I really enjoyed. You could tell there were quite a few flavors married together to create a complex flavor. There were also a few chunks of pork mixed in and some tangy sauce on top. The food is cheap, I think I spent maybe $8. They could easily charge double the price, but you can tell they are a small operation and are here to feed their neighborhood. This may be some of the best bbq I've ever had.

On a recommendation from my father, who is a BBQ guru, I delayed my departure from Memphis until after Payne's opened then next morning. I'm so happy I got to experience this great. This place is located in an old automotive garage in a questionable neighborhood but that only adds to the ambiance. I had to try the chopped pork sandwich, ribs and unique mustard coleslaw. I went to the ATM before I arrived since I read that they only take cash, FYI they now take cards! Ordered the regular chopped pork sandwich which came with hot BBQ sauce and the infamous mustard coleslaw on a bun and I also order 1/2 slab of ribs which comes with coleslaw and had a can of Grape Fanta to wash it all down. The sandwich was tasty and the crunchy bits mixed in are very different and added a nice texture that was unexpected. When I come back I will probably order the slaw on the side because it overpowered the pork a little since the pork was perfect by itself. The ribs were very tender on the inside and and were finished with a nice crunchy sauce. Overall very different from the Texas BBQ that I am accustomed to but in a great way that I was not expecting!

They are kid-friendly, but the main attraction is the food.

Warning: there are a bunch of jalapenos - a good thing, if you like them. Plus it was served with a scratch-made biscuit; crunchy on the outside, warm and fluffy inside. They leave it to you to load the omelet with as much salsa and sour cream as you'd like. Bottom line, it was a terrific omelet.The service was good without a long wait for our food when they had a large number of customers. Oh, they even had live music, a singing guitarist who was not overly loud. Nice touch.They do serve Breakfast all day, so you can decide what you want to try when you. Whenever you go, just go.

I have, however, have had many a lunch at Raffe's Deli and I will tell you that the Snakebite at the Deli is a whole lot better. I got one at the Garden last night and for a sandwich that cost me over seven dollars, I got almost no roast beef. It was pretty much a lettuce sandwich. Also, the sauce is not as hot and the bread is not as good. So, if you want a Snakebite, go to the Deli.The service was pretty bad. We were outside so I don't know if our waitress was the only one working. But if she was, they need more help, or she needs to learn to cope with more than four people. She was in no hurry whatsoever. Which brings me back to my sandwich. This mediocre seven dollar sandwich (with ZERO sides) took thirty minutes to prepare. That number is one hundred percent accurate. Thirty minutes to make a sandwich.Also, I know that they are located right off Poplar which automatically means higher rent. Plus, they have a ton of beer which means they have a large over-head. But, even as imports go, this place is too expensive. If you have tons of disposable income, please be my guest to throw it at a couple of (non-import) beers and a sandwich, because thirty dollars is what it's going to cost you.One more thing, I in no way implied that the waitress should keep the change when I handed her the money for my check. She assumed that on her own and just did. That alone should tell you what kind of place you're dealing with. Pretty sure I won't be back here.",0,88,68,22,0

It's lit with hanging lights and murals on the walls. I think there was only one server for all the tables - maybe about 6 or 7 or even 8 total. I can only comment on the service in the patio area and it was amazing. You receive real napkins but plastic ware for everything else. I would have preferred a metal fork in this case, but it's fine. I do feel this restaurant is a bit more upscale compared to some barbecue locations.Now for the food - I also feel the prices were more here than in previous locations we ate (We tried Silky's ribs & Central BBQ) and this was the most expensive meal for 3 of us - we shared two platters of combo platters. You get a vinegar based cole slaw and beans with each platter. When you take a bite of that cole slaw - be prepared - it is PUNGENT and super sour with the vinegar taste. Not in a bad way, just different and full of flavor! The beans were my favorite of all the beans in all the barbecue locations so far...they had chunks of brisket in them and were sweet and savory in each bite. I ate the entire cup of beans and would get those again anytime.The chicken was grilled and sliced with sauce on most of it. It wasn't bad, but not as tender as I would have liked. I am sure this does not get smoked like the other meats. But I compared this to a chicken breast on my grill at home - pretty similar.The brisket was AMAZING - I agree with the other reviews that this brisket was tender, melts in your mouth, has a full flavor like it's been cooking for days and does NOT need any sauce. It is perfect just like it is. The long strips cut super easy and are so tender. I would definitely get brisket again! I will say it doesn't win as number one for me - that belongs to Pecan Lodge in Dallas, TX...but it's super close!!!Now for the ribs - which is what we had been waiting for. This may seem more of a mixed review but in the end I still rate this super HIGH - on the first bite I knew I loved this flavor. It is charcoal grilled and is not the same as other dry rub ribs in Memphis - but these have a distinct and full-bodied flavor. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth. I scraped off as much meat as I could from each bone. Even the bones were tasty. I mean don't let anything go to waste.  Again, no sauce please...it doesn't need them. The seasoning on the ribs was just right. Not too much. They were cut for us, so no need to pull apart as much as you would at a normal rib location. But these are different...dry rub, but not smoked like others. So if you go in thinking they are going to taste like other Memphis-style ribs, you will be disappointed. Go for the ribs as a taste of ribs and you would probably enjoy these more. I do wish there were more meat on them however, but between the three of us - I got the ends of the ribs, so they were smaller.I also had the sweet tea - which to me was similar to fountain sweet tea, so not a fan like other locations (Gus' Fried Chicken) - but it was fine. I would definitely return for ribs and brisket here again! That taste is something I won't forget.",3,148,124,304,1

There is a lot of season on these which overall is fine, but weren't quite that tender and overall flavor wasn't amazing.  We liked Central much better. This restaurant is more of an old fashioned Italian restaurant though with servers so there is a different feel. The patio was beautiful. The grilled chicken was nothing special; exactly what it states - a grilled chicken breast with bbq sauce on it. The brisket was better than central but i still was not overly impressed.  The coleslaw was very flavorful, very vinegar based and poignant. Some will love, some Will hate.

A few minutes after sitting, our server came and greeted us. We ordered waters and my friend ordered a beer. We also decided to try the bbq chicken nachos as an appetizer. Before our nachos came out, we placed an order for a full slab of ribs for two and double baked beans.The nachos came out and looked really good. There was dry rubbed on top, which was very different. The nachos were just okay - the chicken was great as was the bbq sauce and dry rub, but the cheese sauce tasted kinda cheap. It wasn't quality cheese sauce unfortunately.Our ribs and beans came out pretty fast and looked amazing so we were ready to dig in (I didn't even get a pic lol). However, our excitement sadly ended there. These were probably the most flavorless ribs we both have ever had smh. They were cooked well, but really tasted like nothing.

That said, I got chicken instead of pork/brisket because I wanted something I knew I'd like and it delivered. The sauce is wonderful. Tangy, a little sweet,  not too thick.

I think things started to kind of slow down for him after that.  I got a large order of ribs, which comes with beans and slaw. When the ribs came, there was a moment of silence.  I chowed those pups down, with sauce and without.  IT WAS single handedly the best ribs to ever touch these lips, and I have done some trekking for 'cue in my life time.  I enjoyed them so much, I ordered another large order.  And yes, I finished that one as fast as the first.  The beans were great, and the slaw was alright- but slaw is not my thing.  I do not think they used mayo, and it has a yellow tint (I first thought it was rice).We sat and enjoyed it, and I think my favorite part of the evening was getting to sniff my fingers at a later time and belch that lovely charcoal flavor.  I think it's either time I re-up or go to bed now...",1,32,66,7,1

The hostess pointed (not escorted) my party of three to the rear of the restaurant for seating for us to be greeted with sheer confusion and redirected by someone standing at the bar. The food came quickly but was luke warm. I ordered the brisket/rib platter. My friends both ordered the half rib plate. All entrees arrived with mustard-based cole slaw and baked beans. The baked beans and sweet tea were excellent.  One of the three plates of food was edible.  One plate of ribs were tough and my half rack was charred. I tolerated most of the very fatty brisket which came on a hoagie roll.  To end it all, all three of us had stomach issues within 1 hour of finishing our lunch.  Not sure if I would give this venue another try.

The Rendezvous was founded by Charlie Vergos in 1948 and started out as an 80 seat tavern serving ham and cheese sandwiches. There's some great BBQ joints in every nook and cranny Memphis and I've tried nearly every one over my 23+ years, as a local, but when I'm ready for an authentic Memphis barbecue, with a Memphis feel, make my way to this basement through a downtown alley across from the Peabody Hotel.Speaking of crannies Charlie Vergos while serving his ham & cheese sandwiches discovered an old coal chute that he converted into a smoker to give the ham some flavor, that would be very important some years later. When he started to look to attract a bigger crowd he tried his hand at chicken and oysters, but when his butcher came to him with the one thing he had plenty of ribs, something clicked. At that time in the 50's ribs were actually scrap meat, believe it or not  Ribs had been a staple of backyard barbecues in Memphis neighborhoods a long time but restaurants weren't serving them.  So Vergos came up with the formula that he still uses today. He put the racks of ribs 18 inches from the fire, grilled them for an hour and fifteen minutes to seal in the flavor with a vinegar wash to keep them moist. He also created a rub based on the seasoning from his father's Greek chili recipe and then added cajun spices he discovered on visits to New Orleans. He added paprika to give it a more traditional barbecue color. And that's it. That quickly became the standard for ""Memphis style"" barbecue ribs. Now for some BBQ critique, there's some who disagree with leaving the membrane on but that's the way it's been done here for over a half century, so there's that. You will get dry rubbed by default but you can ask for them wet or half & half. You can also choose the regular or hot bbq sauce, I love the hot. While I find the dry rub ribs tasty they tend to be a bit dry for my taste. The pulled pork is as good as any I've had in the area but there can be a little too much fat and that also can happen with the beef brisket. What I'm saying is depending on your personal preferences you might find reasons to love everything here or there are a lot of other places that may hit more high notes for your pallette. I find BBQ to be a kinda personal thing for lots of folks and if I'm looking for the best chicken it's the smoked Cornish hens at Cozy Corner and I could make several other places for that specific dish that blows me away BUT for THE Memphis barbecue experience, Rendezvous does it for me. They serve their original ham sandwich as well as other sandwiches like pulled pork, chopped or grilled chicken, salami & cheese. The main events are ribs (sorry Texans only pork here), you can also combo up with chicken or brisket, which you can get by themselves and lamb riblets. You can also get a five pound skillet of barbecue shrimp delivered to your table but you have to give them a 24 hour notice for that treat. All the main dishes are served with beans and their vinegar based slaw. They've got a huge tasty  Greek salad and you should order up a pitcher of beer (only beer & wine here) and start with their excellent special sampler platter that has cheese, salami, smoked sausage, pickles & peppers, it's very good. Their bbq nachos are also pretty darn good as well. Bottom line: It's not fine dining, it's a BBQ legend. The service is also friendly, fast and spot on. This is a Memphis must, nuff said .",5,1040,885,7495,1

We asked for some plain chicken stock to help balance out the salt, but the chiCKEN STOCK WAS SALTY TOO. So we had to bring the entire miso ramen home to fix up.

As someone who is accustomed to Louisiana and Gulf Coast seafood, hear me when I say I don't expect much from Memphis crawfish boils. It's unrealistic to assume you're going to get the same quality here. Does it happen? Possibly. I've just never been willing to spend money to find out (except for the Rajun Cajun Festival because it's for a good cause).I've had a taste for crawfish since my last trip to La. a few weeks ago, and decided to try out the Saturday boil at The Bluff. A platter with around two pieces of sausage and a piece of corn is $18. A little pricey for insanely small crawfish, but again -- remember where you are and the cost the restaurant pays to get them. However, the size wasn't my issue. It was the taste. They were over seasoned with ALL the salt in TN. After struggling through half the platter, I mentioned it to the bartender...who said I wasn't the only person who complained. She went to the back and told whoever was cooking them and neither that person or a manager came out to address the issue. So not only did I pay $18 for crawfish soaked in salt, but I paid an additional $2.99 for fries because I couldn't finish what I initially ordered.I think the final straw was seeing a different total on my final receipt because they charge a credit card processing fee. Not a live music fee -- a fee to swipe my card. With tip, I think I spent $34 and some change. And left hungry and mad at myself for getting swindled out of lunch. I've been to TB for drinks. I'll likely go back again when I'm thirsty. But I won't order crawfish, and I def won't order any food simply out of general principle.",2,13,68,158,1

A few months ago I went for brunch, since they hype it up so much on social media, and that was very mediocre with subpar food and drinks (and of course nothing like they feature on their social media). Lately I've mostly come for food only since really the only reason I go now is because they have local deal certificates where I get a discount. I am still a fan of the gator bites, and I think their po boys are pretty good, but I'll say the amounts of the good stuff (the meat) has decreased in portion size over the past year.

A throwback to another time in America. I've lived in Memphis a long time and I've never been to the train station. We parked outside the hotel and walked downstairs to the restaurant. Just a fun feel. We were seated right away and sat at a small but ample table for our foursome. Plenty of social distancing.  No other diners coming and going past our table. Our waiter was amazing. Extremely knowledgeable about how the menu is prepared. He was very nice. Our meal was terrific. My filet was cooked perfectly. The salad maison was very flavorful. I enjoyed the French onion soup. Wasn't the best I've ever eaten but it's very good. My wife decided to have the hamburger. I tasted her burger and it was very tasty. It was presented with a toasted bun but it was little overdone. She doesn't eat an entire bun so it was of little consequence. Had two deserts and they were well prepared and tasty. Beautifully presented. Overall, I give Bishop five stars.

The restaurant is decorated nicely, not too formal but there are touches that elevate the ambiance. Our bartender knew the menu through and through, that was much appreciated. He was able to give thorough descriptions of several dishes and recommendations. We ordered the bone marrow, Parisian gnocchi, bacon tartin (?), mussels and frites, blue crab, poached pear, and the crème brûlée. The bone marrow alone gets 5 stars from me. You won't find anything else like that in memphis! It was perfectly seasoned and creamy - beef butter at its finest. It came with light, airy bread to pair. The Parisian gnocchi was different, they make it with pâte choux instead of potato's but it was still delicious although a bit on the rich side.  The bacon,onion, and cheese tartin was just ok, we didn't really care for it. The texture was of a limp flatbread but the flavors were fine. Can skip. The mussels and frites were cooked in a wine sauce, the wine could've been cooked out more but still tasty. The frites were bleh and I would have much preferred bread to soak up the juices instead of soggy fries. The blue crab had the same issue, the crab was delicious and refreshing but they paired it with mini pancakes? Two soft textures instead of nice, toasted, buttered French bread to go along with the crab dip. Finally, the desserts. The crème brûlée was pathetically small and shallow, we both dipped our spoons in expecting to scoop creamy custard but were met with the *clank* of a spoon meeting the bottom of the dish about 1/4 inch in. The poached pear, on the other hand, was wonderful! Crisp, cold, champagne soaked pear along with a cornbread cake and crema, it was not too sweet nor heavy. All in all, Bishop is still in its ""soft opening"" and definitely has room for improvement *ahem, at the snarky hostess towards the end of the night* but there is potential here. Bone marrow is unique to them and a must have. Definitely pricey but hey, it's a French restaurant.

We had reservations for 8:30pm. We were told by the hostess that we'd have to wait about ten minutes so we sat at the bar for a drink.

Another 30 minutes go by and we're still sitting at the bar waiting for our table so now I ask for the manager. The manager refuses to ask the table to leave and his reason for this is because of COVID (whatever that means). He says that our only option is to leave or wait it out. He seemed out of his league and fragile. He was told that this is unacceptable and that because of his lack of leadership, he would be losing business. As we're about to leave, he runs over to us and announces that a table has finally opened up. We reluctantly sit and place our drink and food orders. The server was very knowledgeable and friendly.

The mint pie? I dont know. I never got mine.  Overall I would not return.  It wasn't worth getting lost and spending 10 minutes trying to park. Bummer. I had such high hopes. Imagine- [ ] Mac. Cold.

The shrimp po boy was just fantastic! I loved the amount of lettuce, pickles, and sauce that they included! I'd never had vegan shrimp, but it's very tasty! The chili fries were also very good! The only downside: I ordered sweet potato fries with chili, and these don't look (or tlike sweet potato to me?

I live 30 mins away so I made the drive and arrived at 6 just to be told that they were closed until 6:30... This isn't posted anywhere, and I'm guessing they did it because they were busy or something? After 35 mins (I placed the order at 6:30 and received it at about 7:05), the cashier puts my food on the counter with my three to-go boxes sideways....... I literally looked at her and just said ""oooookay..?"" and she didn't fix it. My shrimp po boy did not look so hot after that. In addition, we tried the buffalo chicken sandwich, and it was very soggy! They didn't cook the chicken long enough to be crispy for the sandwich.On top of everything, they left 2 of my items off when they handed me my food, and I had to go back in to get it (thank god I checked before I drove home).This place seems very hit or miss, and I'm sure all of the bad reviews are justified.

I wanted to try a lot of their sides so I ordered the veggie plate (4 sides) and also the Chicken Drumsticks, which came with 2 sides.By now, I should know better than to expect a rich flavor profile to vegan mac and cheeses other than my own! The texture and sauce was on point but I felt that the flavor really lacked. I also felt this way about the coleslaw and greens. I wanted to like the greens but they were so salty and not super flavorful other than that. I'm not saying I didn't eat these sides, because I'm a lover of mixing flavors together and I surely ate every single bite. I don't like to waste! And it's not like it was terrible, it just wasn't the best.With all that out of the way, the cornbread was LIT. So were the hushpuppies! The bbq baked beans were banging and I loved the house made chicken drumsticks. So glad I asked for both their honey mustard and ranch dipping sauces. I used both! It seemed like the menu was mainly comprised of store bought vegan meats (maybe gardein products) so I'm glad I opted for something house made since I have those other products at home all the time. I loved the texture and flavor of the vegan chicken and the fact that they put a wooden stick in the center for that old fashioned ""drumstick"" feel.

Even if the food was once frozen, find a way for your customers to not taste it in the food. My advice would be to look at other recipes or to start making things from scratch. If they are already made from scratch, then please reevaluate as this will bring more people within your doors, especially the people who only give vegan food one chance.

We were warned that they only had 3 servers at the time which hinted toward slower service. But right at 11:59 we were allowed in and seated. Our waitress greeted us and took orders right away. Drinks were served, we had the Triple C mimosa and regular mimosa which were both great! We were then greeted by one of the owners Rick who gave us a warm welcome to the establishment. The environment in the establishment was great because everyone was working and food was coming out pretty quickly.

It's always nice to find an independent coffee shop because there are so few of those around.  The decor is pretty cool. It's cozy inside with free wifi, a bookshelf and games if you want to play with friends.  At first thought it's expensive but still on par with Starbucks price wise. Considering it's a small business I don't mind paying a bit more.So why only 2 stars?While the barista was vert sweet he was the only person working there. For a coffee shop that size they should have had 2 people there. They couldn't keep up. My fiance got a hot chocolate and I got a cappuccino. Both our drinks took 15 minutes to make (we were only the 2nd people in line) and came to use lukewarm.  Our S'mores bar and Espresso Brownie were tasty. But the hot chocolate tasted like a chocolate flavored marshmallow and my cappuccino tasted like a bitter espresso fart. There wasn't flavor to anything we were drinking (And I work for an Italian company, I know my espresso drinks), for the price I expected to at least get a hot drink in a timely manor.The table next to me was so dusty (as seen in the picture) and I realized it was pottery dust. Now the pottery classes they have are pretty cool. But it's in the same section where all the food/drink is served and I'm not sure how clean/safe that is.

I skipped the mustard as I've found it that it can sometimes overpower the other flavors on a sandwich. Let's start with the bread...man oh man. It was sweet, soft and lightly toasted. It did a great job of holding the contents of the sandwich together. The white slice of cheese was heftier than I expected. The chicken breast was lightly fried, which I did not expect. I'm usually hesitant to order chicken breast sub sandwiches as I've found deli-style chicken breast meat to be on the drier side, but this was delicious, juicy and flavorful. The breading was relatively light, so I didn't feel like I was eating a traditional fried chicken sandwich. The combination of lettuce, tomato and onion added a familiar texture to the sandwich. The condiments, specifically the Italian dressing, added a unique zing to the sandwich that elevated it to another level. The oily and vinegary concoction paired well with the creamy mayo. The two were well distributed on the sandwich, so no bite was dry.I was torn between the 8- and 12-inch options, but I'm glad I stuck with the 8-inch. It's a very filling sandwich.

Global Cafe calls itself an ""international food hall"" on its website. But it's really small. On a busy Saturday, it was hectic and tight and cramped. Unlike most food halls I've been to, you don't make your purchase at the food stand you order from, but instead walk over a check out area. The problem with this is that there wasn't really room to get over from the food stand we ordered from to get to the cash register to pay! We ended up splitting up and paying in two separate installments because we had two trays and it there was no where to set them down by the register. I was worried I was going to spill my okra and beef stew, because I had to wind past so many people to get from the stand to the checkout. It just isn't a good layout for this concept. I could see if you made it more like a traditional cafeteria (with a counter all the way around for trays), but the space available here really didn't work with this concept for me at all. To be honest, if I hadn't been with other people, I might have just left rather than dealing with the process. All that said, I do love the concept, which hosts three ""immigrant/refugee food entrepreneurs."" Right now, they have Syrian, Sudanese, and Venezuelan dishes available, and you can read bios of the ""food entrepreneurs"" on the tables when you sit. We tried dishes from the Sudanese and Syrian menus, and the food was mostly okay. From the Syrian menu, we tried bamia (okra with stewed beef) with rice, which was okay (a warm dish on a chilly day, but not anything I'll crave again); the mixed vegetables with tzatziki sauce (okay, pretty standard); one each of the spinach and cheese pies with tabouleh (the pies weren't great, but the tabouleh was tasty); and fasoliyyeh (seared green beans with beef), which was okay as well. From the Sudanese menu, we tried the soup of the day (roasted vegetable), which was very standard vegetable soup, and the ground beef sambusas, which were easily the hit at the table. For the most part, I found the food just all right. All that being said, we were there on a really busy day. And I might have had a totally different experience had there not been an event going on that day at Crosstown Concourse. But I also didn't love the food. So I can't say that I really want to go back to try it out on a less busy day or an off hour. I really love the concept of highlighting international cuisines that Americans aren't as familiar with. I just didn't think the space or layout or the fact that you have to pay in separate area was great. And the food wasn't great on this occasion either. Maybe if they had a larger space with more room for the cooks to move around (because their space seemed really small as well), this concept would work a little better?",0,144,6,1,0

I ordered the Soup of the Day from the Sudanese station which turned out to be a peanut spinach vegetable soup that comes with a potato cheese bread. The bread roll was warmed up and served with the GIANT bowl of soup and came out to $7. I could've split my soup portion into at least 2 meals which is amazing.After you get your food, you pay at the bar counter, which offers many drinks and bar seating as well.

I liked the sauce this time. There was a lot of sauce and I mean in a good way. The trouble is that I don't know if they'll be consistent enough to serve it the same way next time. After I'd written my last review in June, Will contacted me and identified himself as the owner. He spent a lot of time explaining things to me and said the dough didn't look like it hadn't proofed for a full 8 hours. He told me his prices are set to cover labor, overhead, and food costs. The Wisconsin cheese they use is very expensive.  I don't necessarily think it's over priced anymore, but I can spend less on other options that I happen to like better. Will was such a nice guy in so many ways. He was so professional in the way he approached me that I wanted to meet him and I wanted to like his food. I didn't accept his offer of a refund, and he never asked me to change my review. I did however decide to remove a couple of insulting comments and bad jokes I had made. My bad! I called for Will on a Saturday and asked for him today. He wasn't at the restaurant either time. I was hoping he could win me over, but it just didn't happen. Other than being able to taste the sauce, I liked how the pepperonis were cooked crispy on top. Also I ate the crust this time. I would call this more of a hand tossed than a thick pizza. My first thick pizza was a thin pizza with a thick edge. This one was hand tossed thickness and had lost the thick edge. The dough is the wrong color, consistency, and taste to me. I removed the cheese and toppings on a slice so I could eat the dough with just the sauce, and the dough took on a whole different flavor and texture. It was more like a bread to me than a pizza. The mushrooms are definitely fresh, but they're chopped up too small. There's something about the cheese I don't care for, but its hard to describe. Once again, I'll comment and complain about service. There was a handwritten list of draft beer at the register from which I selected Blue Moon. Girl #1 didn't know how to ring it up and had to ask girl#2 who explained the procedure to her. Girl #2 said she would get my beer because girl #1 didn't have a permit. The thing was, she didn't get my beer and my pizza literally came first. I asked for it when the pizza came to the table. Ordered beer at 12:13. Beer delivered at 12:28. $4 for a 16 oz draft? Yep. Come on its lunchtime! One of the employees was walking through the dining room clearing tables and noticed I was finished with 3 slices left. She was friendly when she said it, but she offered me another beer and pointed to where I could get myself a carry out box. So I walked across the room and got one. I didn't leave a tip. Actually at the time I just didn't think about it. Just felt like the kind of place that doesn't do that. My wife thought the leftovers were ok. Leftovers in June never got eaten.",16,236,636,4487,1

It was priced higher than what I can buy elsewhere. -1star. For this price, I felt like they should provide full table service. -1star.I'll start with service. I walked in and chose a table to sit at, and waited. Then I went up to the counter to order when I saw others doing the same. A big sign saying ""order here"" kind of gave me a clue. The menu board was difficult for me to understand and it wasn't until my turn to order that I discovered the printed menu. I wanted a simple pizza to try anyway, and the employee directed me to look above to see the pizza pans hanging so I could gauge their size. The large wasn't very impressive, and the small was tiny, so I opted for medium. She asked if I wanted thick or thin. I asked her if it was a deep dish and if it was super oily. She answered yes/no to those questions so I chose ""thick"". I don't think she understands what deep dish pizzas are. I asked for a Bud but instead got a Bud Light. I gave it back to her and asked for a Bud instead. She was very confused about that. They did bring beer and pizza to my table, but it's counter order and counter pay.The dough was completely wrong in every way. There was nothing ""thick"" about it. I would never call this pizza ""thick"". They aren't using the right yeast and proofing it correctly is my guess. The dough didn't get browned on the bottom because it wasn't cooked properly. It was more like a flour biscuit than a pizza dough. That's my opinion. I usually like to eat the crusts, but I discarded these. Toppings are $1.50 each for a medium. At this price, I felt like the toppings were scarce. The pepperonis were average and did get cooked a little bit. I don't think the mushrooms were canned, but they kind of seemed to have been put in a food processor. The sauce just tasted so generic. My best guess is that it was canned. Finally the cheese was so much different than the pizzas I am used to. The color, the taste, and the texture was just wrong. The inside of the building was pretty cool in some ways, but in others was just weird. The Coca Cola couch was cool as were some of the other memorabilia, but the tree stumps hanging from the ceiling is weird. The electrical classroom display is the craziest thing I've ever seen at a toilet. It's a fairly big place. I'll bet they can seat 120 people.",0,12,98,19,1

It had cute decor, friendly staff. Went here on a Friday night to give it a try. The menu offered interesting picks, but I found the prices to be outrageous. I figured, maybe it will be worth it. We shared a house salad and a large Happy Hippie Pie. First off, this restaurant does not know what it wants to be. It wants to be a counter-service  kind of place like PizzaRev, but for the prices and the general decor of the place it would be much better as a standard wait-service restaurant. It just doesn't mesh. The counter-service is for casual places, yet the prices are so high you'd expect wait-service. Then you have the bar on the other end of the cashier, so if you order a beer or wine, you have to pay at the register, then walk yourself, or a staff member goes for you, to the bar to get your drink. Again, it doesn't know what it wants to be. So right from the start the atmosphere was not on point. So for the wines, they have quite a few to choose from. I ordered a red blend. Nowadays, red blends are typically chilled. Mine was warm and dripping down the sides of my glass. That was disappointing. We seat ourselves with our little number card and the salad quickly comes out. The staff member brings a sleeve of cutlery for one, so I ask for another plate and tell her we are sharing the salad. She brings the plate but then I have to ask again for another set of cutlery. Again, this is where a decision on counter service or wait-service would help. If its counter-service, I can grab my own plates or cutlery at a designated location. If its wait service, the cutlery would already be at the table. It just creates confusion among customers and more work for the wait staff. Pick one!Okay so let's get to the food, specifically the 20$ pizza which honestly was the size of a medium pizza at dominoes. It was such a huge let-down. The crust had no flavor, the sauce had no flavor, the cheese had no salt. The veggies were few and far between. The only redeeming quality of this pizza was the consistency of the dough, a little doughy which I kind of like. For the first time in my life, I had to put salt on a pizza. It was the most expensive, flavorless pizza I have ever purchased. This place has so much potential because of the location, the staff, and decor, It just has to go back to the cookbook and learn the basics.",2,184,329,2679,1

My ""chicken pieces"" come out slightly warm to slightly cool.  General Tso's sauce was VERY unimpressive.  No spice at all!   Deep dish pizza crust was just ok.  No crunchiness in the dough on the edges. The bacon I ordered on the pizza wasn't real bacon at all. It was like tough little bacon by product pieces or something.  The sauce was canned and the pepperonis were staring in the same pathetic show.  Top it off, very little cheese...   All in all unimpressed.  Glad it was half off to start.  Thanks Amazon!",0,55,648,125,1

You go up to the counter order, get a number and then drinks to the side, so no table service. My pizza arrived pretty fast and I was happy with the size (4 slices) and all the toppings were fresh, amounts were decent, plus the dough was cooked. This was a solid 3-star vegetarian pizza, even if nothing really distinguished or lifted it out to create a spectacular or unusual taste. The cheese tasted like plastic and if I were to come back here again, I'd either swap it out for some fresh mozzarella or  feta, or even perhaps leave it out altogether.The Yelp group then split the Strawberry Fields Dessert Pizza and the Chocolate Cheesecake Dessert Pizza and frankly, these were a real disappointment. All of us are foodies and instantly started re-imagining these as better versions, as the ""sauce"" seemed to be some kind of overtly-sweet graham cracker crumbles and for the Strawberry Dessert Pizza, we had just expected heaps more strawberries (this was not a field!!). I reimagined this and thought it would have tasted better with the omission of the sauce, so keep it as just the crust, then the base covered with strawberries and then the drizzle of the cheesecake icing, so it would be similar to a strawberry torte. I could only take one bite of the Chocolate Cheesecake Dessert Pizza - it had the same graham cracker ""sauce"" and then a drizzle of Hershey's chocolate sauce and cheesecake icing. I personally really dislike the taste of Hershey's chocolate, so that was a massive negative for me. Everyone around the table however was in agreement that this dessert pizza needed more chocolate, and a great suggestion was made by someone that the dough could have included chocolate chips and marshmallows for an additional topping.  I also found the dough for both Dessert Pizzas to be under-baked, and I walked away thinking their inclusion on the menu seemed to be more of a gimmick. It's a pity really, as the Dessert Pizzas had the potential to be so much more and even something, if done right, that the Lost Pizza Company could be known around Memphis for. However as it stands today, I would honestly suggest avoiding the Dessert Pizzas. Note: #90 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016",3,467,1684,7515,0

Lost should definitely train its staff to be more attentive to customer needs. The pies are way overpriced for the size. The pizza is just not that good. The ingredients were just average quality and the consistency of the crust is odd.

It's definitely my favorite coffee in Memphis. My number one favorite aspect of this place is how spacious it is. It's HUGE.  I don't know about you, but when I'm going to coffee shops to study or do some work I always have this latent anxiety that there won't be any room for me to sit and I'll walk in with a backpack, look around for somewhere to sit, LOOK LIKE A FOOL because there isn't, order coffee and act like I just carry around my backpack for fun, and then leave feeling like a fool. Okay don't lie I know you feel that way too.Well here's the good news - I promise you there's always so much space in Otherlands. Not only do they have a huge indoors space consisting of 3-4 rooms, depending on how you parse it, but they also have a really spacious patio with quite a few outdoors tables well. However, I can't always promise you that you'll get an outlet, because they could definitely benefit from a few more power strips or something.Also worth mentioning, the atmosphere is really cozy and also kinda hip / bohemian.

The kitchen sink omelet is tasty.I visited Cafe Eclectic yesterday for Saturday Brunch. Much to my surprise, they were not busy at all and we were able to be seated right away... But that's where the good part stops. Not many good things to say about the service. It took around 30 mins to flag down someone to take our order. I ordered an omelet and my husband wanted a sausage biscuit, but they were fresh out of biscuits. So the server decided on just putting in our drink orders and said he would return shortly to take our food order, to give my husband a few minutes to decide on something else to eat. Yet another 15-20 minutes of flagging down our server again. My husband even stood up in the front for 5 minutes to see if he could just place his order up there so we could get the food started. Once the food order was placed, it probably took around 45 minutes for it to come out. Drinks came out after 15-20 minutes. When the food did finally come out, low and behold my omelet was ordered incorrectly by the server. Waiting for the correct order to be cooked, they decided after about 10 mins to let my husband have his bagel sandwich and it was already cold. Another 20 minutes go by and I finally have the correct omelet.After our brunch taking much longer than expected, we were in a hurry to pay and hit the road. We weren't given a bill, just the server saying the total out loud and then handing his card reader over to pay. While on en route to our next location, I realized how the bill did not add up. $37 for a bagel sandwich, omelet, and 2 drinks? I then realized they must have charged us for both the omelets: the wrong order that I never touched and the correct one. That was the cherry on top of a horrible experience.Decided to tack on an extra star because the Kitchen Sink omelet was very tasty and the cremebrulatte & hot cocoa were pretty yummy. Not many other good things to say about the place. I do my best to be understanding of mistakes, but it's hard to be empathetic to a serving team that hardly pays attention to their patrons.

The place is somewhat dark inside, low lights and blue film on windows to blockout the sunlight. A saxophonist and piano filled the restaurant with great music.  There was an abbreviated, limited menu due to COVID.  I started with a shrimp cocktail appetizer. I thought $16.00 for three medium/large shrimp was a bit high. The shrimp were served with a homemade cocktail sauce that sort of tasted and looked like a jelly or jam. I wasn't overly hungry so I ordered a bowl of the ""Soup of the Day"" which was French Onion ($10.00.) It was mediocre in taste, not one of the best, but ok.I found the food ok, prices high and atmosphere swanky. Give it a try. Great service.",2,61,449,760,1

The creamed spinach is decent, kind of felt like it was missing something though. My friends got the cajun pasta and ate it all. They said it was delicious. I mean you can't really go wrong with a spicy, creamy pasta. The portion sizes here are spot on also.  We decided to get dessert too, so we ordered a cobbler of the day (peach) and the chocolate brownie... both were a great way to end our amazing meal.

Let me just say, I am so glad that I found this place! It is hidden downtown right behind BB King's on Beale St., so it's very easy to miss. I guess it's one of those places that you just have to know where it is. I had to call to find out. Anyway, once you make it up those stairs...get ready for one of the best dining experience!When you walk in, you will notice that it is a very intimate setting. The lights are dim, the music is soft and soothing, and the staff is all dressed and ready to cater to you. For starters, I had the Crab Cakes. They were not your traditional fried crab cakes. It seems that they baked them, so don't be shocked like I was by the soft consistency. I also had the Blues Berry Martini. It was pretty good and semi-strong. The bread that they gave was soft and baked to perfection. Loved it! On to our entrées. I had the Rotisserie Chicken with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans. Let me tell you that I enjoyed every bit. The chicken was moist and seasoned to what I would call perfection, plus they give you a large portion. The potatoes reminded me of my Mom's (and that is a huge compliment, lol). This was an overall great experience and I look forward to going back!",6,1306,448,2277,1

If you're looking for a fine dining experience in Memphis look no further!Don't get me wrong, I'm all about the southern cooking, smoked BBQ and put-me-in-a-coma fried chicken that Memphis has to offer, but I'd go back to Itta Bena in a heart beat! This place is uniquely located above BB King's on the corner of Beale. You have to find the not-so-obvious entrance covered with an awning to climb the stairs that lead you to the wonderful dining room. The blue tinted windows give you a great view of the busy streets and bars while setting the ""blues mood"" and putting off a nice vibe for your dinner. If you're lucky, you'll get Ashley as your server! She was phenomenal!! I cannot say enough good things about her. She definitely added to our experience. When scanning the menu and deciding on appetizers we were unsure if we wanted to settle with the scallops & grits (I'm not a big grits fan, i know I know...I'm from the North) or go with something different. She was quick to give us a sample of the Gouda grits to try before deciding. Let me tell you, I don't favor grits by any means but wow, those were good! They use a Delta grind grit and I believe it made all the difference in the world. I may have come across the one and only grits I like!*spoiler alert, we didn't order the scallops and grits but it wasn't because of the grits!Now for our meal...Appetizers:- Crab cakes: OMG! These were HANDS DOWN some of the best crab cakes I've ever had! I'm extremely picky when it comes to crab cakes because these days it's hard to find a crustacean patty that's not at least half filler and full of other nonsense (bleh). These were packed with lump crab meat and had very little filler at all, if any!! I highly recommend!- Crab stuffed Avocado: Okay, so maybe there's a theme here... this was interesting and flavorful! I enjoyed this one-of-a-kind dish. A flash fried avocado with lump crab in the center and topped with pico de Gallo and remoulade. Quite refreshing and on the lighter side. Entrees:- Pan seared halibut: WOW! If you're looking for a buttery, flaky fish that'll melt in your mouth, this is the fish for you! Great flavor, cooked to perfection! I subbed the sweet potatoes for garlic mashed potatoes (not a fan of sweet potatoes) and I'm so glad I did. The Brussel leaves were a good way to mix up the textures and flavors.- Boneless braised Short rib: HOLY SMOKES this sauce was good! This is a VERY hearty, wholesome home cooked meal! Substituted the potatoes for Brussel sprouts for a lighter option. Packed full of the perfect blends of flavors. This dish speaks for itself. Prepare to feel full, fat and satisfied after eating this!!

The glass was shattered on my sister's pants, and as she tried to clean it she had tiny glass fibers stuck in her hand. We each received our checks, and she was charged full price.

I was doing the same, so I stopped. Parking is scant in front, maybe 6 spots. There was a sign for parking in back, but its only accessible from one side. Inside is a pretty barebones set up (But it is clean). Regular tables and chairs, not much decor. The menu has good looking offerings, but mostly the same stuff, but presented differently (pork inside plantains, pork in corn shell, etc.). THE FOOD: I ordered a combo type dish which had an arepa, a patacone, a corn pancake with cheese inside and on top, and I think an empanada. The corn pancake was delicious..sweet, cheesy, almost dessert-like. The arepa and patacone were kind of similar tasting. I got pork in both, they both had the same cheese, the plantains were sliced thin and overfried, so the plantain flavor was lost. The empanada was ok. My server was a nice young lady. Friendly, polite. The food came out quickly. Its ok",0,5,18,4,0

They don't do online ordering but we gave them a call and we're told it'd be ready in about 30 minutes. We ordered a margherita pizza and cheese sticks. It was about $35 which seemed a bit pricey but we thought if it's good it'll be worth it. We went to pick it up and the restaurant looked cute with a nice patio area for dine in. The pizza smelled and looked good so we were hopeful. It is a thin crust pizza and the toppings were almost as thick as the crust. The pizza was... okay. Nothing special, it gave me the taste of frozen pizza we could've bought for much cheaper at Kroger. The cheese sticks were flavorless which for me was the most disappointing part.

Tasted absolutely amazing.Baked Ravioli- Good flavor but probably not homemade. It is tasty though.Meatballs- These were really great with a very light taste even though they were large.The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the Marinara sauce tasted pretty generic. Not a lot of flavor.Love the place and the fact that we could eat inside or outside.",1,34,22,24,0

So I really loved the shoppes - it reminded me so much of when I lived in Canberra where each suburb is ringed around with its local shops! They had a special going on for St. Paddy's and so the 6 of us decided to get half a Dubliner and half Wild Mushroom and it was cut into x12 pieces, so everyone got to try a piece. I loved the zestyness of the Dubliner - the cheese included an Irish cheddar, which really added a zing. Compared to the Dubliner, frankly the Wild Mushroom wasn't that great. I liked that it was fresh mushrooms, but I wish it was either more mushrooms or less cheese? That earthiness I associate with mushrooms was missing? Maybe adding some truffle oil to the mushrooms would elevate it? Apart from the Dubliner - they had a great light beer, if wheat beers are your thing - the Nitro White Ale was excellent and thanks to Yelper Daniel for sharing it around!

We didn't think anything of it until I noticed they serve other customers in glass--even those seated after us.After looking over the menu we were ready to order. Our waiter came and informed us that they were out of ramen noodles, they only had rice or spinach noodles available. Would have been nice to be told when we received the menu so we could factor this in--I mean, it's a ramen restaurant. Oh well, we all changed our minds and picked rice dishes and yakitori. The yakitori that came out was inconsistent each time. We ordered multiple beef tongue skewers. My husbands included seasoning on the side. My grandpa received the same order but with a lemon and seasoning, then my aunt with neither a lemon or seasoning. Consistency is important in not only presentation but in what you're serving! Makes me wonder what other inconsistencies happen in the kitchen. The shio pork belly yakitori was our favorite--tender and juicy. Beef tongue yakitori was good also. I think the Kara-age don was excellent but could really do without the teriyaki sauce soaking the rice. I added a fried egg and Japanese curry sauce on the side. Katsu-don was very tender but a very rather thin piece of pork chop, it also had way too much rice. It wasn't consistent with the other rice bowls we ordered. My husband enjoyed his gyu-don but wished there was more beef, mostly because it was good! Our waitress was very nice but the hostess/waitress was not. I believe she was only supposed to be hostess but I noticed her helping other customers grabbing items for customers, refilling waters, and answering questions about the menu. When my grandpa asked her for some lemon she passed him onto our waitress and left without saying a word. When we called her to ask a question she ignored us.

Then we both ordered the Soy Tonkotsu Ramen under his recommendation.The skewers were bland. Absolutely no seasoning. Not even salt or pepper. The beef tongue was overcooked and tough to chew. The soup base for the ramen was served at luke-warm temperatures and the braised pork belly was COLD. I understand the menu states boiled egg to be included in the ramen, but I personally think it should be a soft boiled egg like most traditional ramen. But it's most disappointing to discover that their ramen soup is simply made from a concentrated base where you simply add hot water.Also as a personal opinion, I think their ventilation system should be improved. It was slightly smoky upon arrival and your skin and clothes will smell of that kitchen restaurant smell.",1,434,101,142,1

My significant other and came out to try the Chef's Tasting menu and it was insanely good. The pairing of wine to each course was elegantly thought out and complimented everything nicely. The first course was a yellow fin dish. Nothing crazy but I wasn't sure how the rest of the meal was going to be based off this first dish. In hindsight it was light and fresh which was a great start to the meal. Second course was a burrata with beets, plums, fennel, and this beautiful black garlic vinaigrette. I know it's almost crazy to say but I maybe could have done with out the burrata because everything else was so good but I really can't complain. Third course was a sea bass, cacio e pepe, grilled lemon, and rosemary cream. That sea bass was the star of the entire meal. It was perfectly cooked and the grilled lemon really came through and complimented the fish. The pasta was good but nothing to write home about. (I'm writing this an hour after dinner and I'm still thinking about that sea bass). Fourth course was a wagyu strip, acorn squash, and a pumpkin puree. A very good combination that was thought out very well. The squash was insane and I could've kept on eating it. For my first experience with wagyu, it was good but nothing out of this world like I thought I'd have been missing. Lastly we had desert and it was a caramel Bavarian cream which was nice and light to end the meal. Overall our waitress Rachel was attentive but not pressing and really aided to an amazing experience. I applaud the chef for his choices on the menu and the execution of each dish.

The price didn't match the overall experience. Mr. Erling... you are a very nice man and we truly appreciate your hospitality.  I wish you many more years of success. However, the price has to be consistent with the overall experience and that's how people decide where to spend their hard earned money. Money spent that isn't hard earned, that's probably much easier to spend without looking at the big picture. You have a lot going for you and your business is successful I know but just keep in mind that if you want to stand out above everyone else in town it should be for quality not just price.

Desserts were 5 stars- the soufflé and the blueberry cobbler with cinnamon ice cream were delicious. So for the 3 of us, with wine was $262...pricey. That's fine, but at that price, I expect 5 star service and it was a 2. We were rushed, plates weren't cleared in a timely fashion, water glasses sat empty and our server was very unprofessional, even though she said she worked there 6 years. And to top it off, she reached across us several times, bumbed my chair repeatedly and almost hit my head with the salad plate clearing had I not ducked. She made the dining experience miserable. The owner shouldn't put up with that service at those prices. I expect a 5 star experience from the food, the table service, and everything in between.

Personally passed on the mustard seed and sauce, not my thing. The scallops could easily stand on their own. The expresso cream boule was just decadent... melt in your mouth.

First, I was in awe to see the Pyramid. I love Bass Pro Shops, but this was another level - so much to do and see!Our reservation was at 7:20 and we got there right at 7:20 and told the employee at the line to get into the elevator. She checked our name and guided us to wait in line. The line for the restaurant wasn't too bad, but the line to go up to Lookout was kinda crazy. And between only two elevators, the elevators having to travel so many stories so slowly, and social distancing on the elevators, it took forever! We didn't get up to the restaurant until after 8pm. When we got to the hostess's stand, we were told to wait for a table to be ready because they were slammed and they told us we could go out to the patio and look out/take pics if we please. We did and the view was breathtaking. The sun had just set, so it was absolutely stunning. We intended to watch the sunset, but the wait prevented that.When we finished, we went back to the hostess stand and a table still wasn't ready, but after a few minutes, they made some things happen and we were able to be seated. Our server was completely slammed, but still did his best to take care of us. We ordered two cocktails - a Memphis belle for me and an old fashioned for my friend. For our entrees, I chose the fried chicken and he went with the grilled chicken. We also ordered side Caesar salads to come out first.Everything came out pretty quickly. The drinks were good, but I'd never seen an old fashioned pinkish-orange lol. Our salads were pretty standard; they had a lot of cheese though. I should've asked for the cheese and dressing on the side. Our entrees were absolutely delicious! The fried chicken with gravy was really good, fried well, and seasoned perfectly. My friend's grilled chicken was really good too! The pairing of sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese was different but definitely a hit. We're both gonna try that at home one night soon.Overall, we had a great time at the Lookout. Aside from the wait, this experience was pretty flawless!",6,280,167,411,1

It is located inside Bass Pro Shops but before it became this interesting landmark it was first the Pyramid Arena, it was supposed to be occupied by the [Memphis] Grizzlies but I don't know what happened to that deal. After taking a ride up the country's tallest free-standing elevator we enjoyed the views of the downtown Memphis skyline and the Mississippi River. We were able to step outside on the observation deck for panoramic views, not quite 360° since there was a break in one section. We stepped inside to step outside again for another view at a different angle from the lookout. The Lookout restaurant was closed due to Covid-19 but the saltwater aquarium in the middle was pretty cool. The admission for the elevator ride was reduced from $10 to $7/adults.

The server even allowed me to switch out my tea selection - very accommodating.- The blueberry scone was EXCELLENT, warm and served with clotted cream and strawberry jam.- It was very easy to make a reservation by phone and they could fit us in with just a day notice.- The main room was lovely - ambiance would have been lovey in there.The not so good- There were several empty tables in the main room, but we were seated in the room right to the left of the entrance in the corner, by a bridal tea party group of about 10. This wouldn't be too much of an issue, but there was a kid playing his video game on full volume the entire time which totally wrecked the ambience. I get that the restaurant can't control its guests, but the staff should have seen that this would have been less than pleasant for me and my boyfriend and put us in the main room. - The food was just okay. The scone was the star and the chicken salad sandwich was okay, but we left half the desserts uneaten (and this is very unusual for us). The macaron and the opera cake in particular were disappointing. Bottom line - the quality and quantity of these ingredients is not worth the price.

What a great Thanksgiving meal.  The first one I've ever not cooked and I was so pleased.  Plus my feet did not hurt and there was no mess to clean up.  The deserts, I had no room for them, but ate them anyway.  The pastry chef is awesome!  So delicious.  And they sent us away with macaroons in a cute little box.The Peabody hotel had three Thanksgiving options, the hotel itself does a buffet (looked amazing), the Italian restaurant also does a Thanksgiving meal, then Chez Philippe does one.  I had such a hard time deciding which one to book, I decided to choose based on Yelp reviews of the restaurants themselves.  I made the right choice!  Would do this again in a heartbeat.  Could actually make this a Thanksgiving tradition.",6,39,481,1602,1

One of the best meals Ive ever eaten in my life. The restaurant is located in the famous Peabody Hotel. The entire hotel is stunning and I highly recommend spending some time exploring either before or after the meal. Especially save time to see the infamous Peabody Ducks!! (Google it if you don't know what I mean).Now time for the menu. This restaurant is all based on pre fix choices. You can get a 4-course meal for $95 a person or a 7-course meal for $135 a person. I chose the 4-course option however I was presented with extra courses totaling eight separate dishes. The service was fantastic always offering water or bread refills between courses and  there was never too long of a wait. The menu had four different sections and I was told to choose one from each part. From the garden choices I decided on the smoked beef tartare. From the ocean choices I decided on the scottish langoustines. From the land choices I decided on the local filet mignon. And for the confection choices I decided on the creme brulee. The first course I got was the amuse bouche which is compliments of the chef and gets you geared up for their style of cooking. I forgot what exactly it was but it tasted like goat cheese on one side and a jelly on the other. It was fantastic! Next I got the beef tartare. It had an egg on top which I mixed into the dish to add more flavor. The smokiness was a bit much for my tasting but the egg helped make it a little more mild. Next I was given the langoustines. Once again it had an egg on top that I mixed into the risotto. (Definitely got my fare share of protein during this meal). The risotto was prepared so wonderfully with the seasoning. Third course I was presented with a raspberry sorbet, which confused me a bit because it was before my steak. However it was very good and I enjoyed it. Next I got the filet mignon. The steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it and it was served with very interesting whipped/crusted potatoes. For the sixth course I was presented with the creme brulee I ordered. It was a trip featuring apple, pecan, and pistachio. I listed them in the order of my preference.I was extremely stuffed after the meal but was still presented with some extra desserts of key lime pie and peanut butter squares. I had to ask for them to go. And finally while getting the check to pay for the meal I was presented with my last course which was french macarons in a cute little box to take home.

Once inside Chez Philippe, I knew I was in for a treat, as usual. They definitely pay attention to the details of setting a beautiful table. They also understand service at its highest level.High tea is quite the production of three courses with multiple teas to choose from as well as champagne. First up is a savory course, served on silver tiered tray. You have one of each nibble for the number of people in your party. Next up is a scone with Devonshire cream and jam. Yesterday's version was blueberry, still warm from the oven. Finally, another three tiered silver server appears with the dessert course. We were so full that most of that went home with us.Dinner is equally splendid. Service is impeccable and the food is always divine. Well worth the trip downtown.

We were two of only 5 people seated at 630 pm on a Tuesday night and researched the huge menu counterside in this little walkup order diner. We decided on two fried catfish and shrimp baskets, some peel and eat shrimp, and grilled mahi with a side salad. Unfortunately, they were out of crab legs and lobster But, I ordered a big frozen lime margarita which made feel REALLY happy with its beauty and strength!  Everything was so good! It was a proper feast for 2 for around 70 bucks which is very reasonable in our eyes. The place is super casual, with checked flannel table cloths and a fish shack theme complete with Billy Bass and friends. Employees were friendly and quick, cooking the food and calling our number as it came up. I have to say the fried catfish and shrimp baskets, with fries and homemade hushpuppies were INCREDIBLE, the best coating and flavor and SO fresh. Absolutely wonderful taste and texture. Best catfish I have ever had. The grilled mahi was cut a little thin for my liking, slightly overcooked, and the person taking my order didnt explain that there are 4 ways to have it prepared. I would have ordered the spicy cajun, but got plain grilled. Luckily, a to go customer at the counter when we walked in said "" whatever you order, ask for a side of garlic butter with it. It's phenomenal!!"" So I did, and poured this garlicky, citrus, herby butter sauce over my fish. Made it delicious again!!

It hurts my heart. WHY IS IT SO EFFECTIVE IN THIS RESTAURANT? My fiance and I were craving crab legs and crawfish- I've been everywhere in midtown looking for crawfish for two weeks, to no avail. He found Flying Fish on google, and we headed that way.Parking in Peabody Place was $10, because it was a busy Saturday with nice weather, and the street parking was unavailable. We walked a few doors down to Flying Fish and immediately felt welcomed by both the atmosphere and the manager. The checkered tablecloths indicate a casual feel, the seats are comfy, fans were rolling, and there is comical decor everywhere. Guests who bring photos of their fishing stories are added to the bathroom walls and there are Big Mouth Billy Bass EVERYWHERE in the front room (guests who bring their unwanted Billy Bass in get a free basket of catfish). I am not a fan of ordering at a counter. I am too ADHD (or maybe old) to read off of a wall menu. I asked for a regular menu, and we found a pound of crawfish, two pounds of snow crab legs, and a dozen oysters, plus two beers. The buzzer erupted in lights and vibration only moments later, and FOUR HUGE TRAYS of food were waiting for us to bring them to our table. I realized I'd forgotten to order some hush puppies, and the manager gave us a few for free. We began to dig in to the potatoes, corn, crab, crawfish, and oysters, realizing our beers were beautifully matched to the well-seasoned seafood (thankfully not presented in a wet plastic bag like newer gimmicky places in the area). We ate, gratefully, and both agreed the oysters at Flying Fish were the best we've ever had in Memphis. Sweet, not salty or too meaty. Here is where the DIY aspect of the place comes in handy. Need a lemon? Don't wait for a server, go get the lemon from the condiment bar! Everything is a short walk and grab away.

We arrived right around dinner time and were ready for something to eat. Our tour guide recommended this place.Atmosphere: It felt kinda like a glorified, southern McDonalds. Fast pasted, people coming and going, lots of conversation. There were plenty of tables even while it was busy. There were some eclectic decorations though which made it seem nicer than a McDonalds. Lighting was fine. Appropriate for children and families. Service: Like most restaurants in the south, you order at the counter, get a buzzer, pay, and find your own seat. You get a cup for your beverage and can fill it yourself. So, we didn't really have a waiter/waitress. I will say that the woman at the register was very pleasant and answered my questions without any attitude. Our food came out quickly, no more than 10 minutes I think, even though it was crowded. When you are done you leave your dishes on the table and someone clears the table for the next person. I was watching and noticed they moved quickly and did do a fairly thorough job of wiping down the tables. Food: I got the ""Snappy Tilapia"" plate that came with rice and beans and grilled zucchini. For the plates you can get your fish tradition, snappy, or with garlic butter. I wanted to have some flavor and I certainly got it. The snappy seasoning is very spicy. It's good, if you like that cajun spice. I advise you to eat slowly because it hits you fast. The fish itself was cooked nicely, I got a nice big piece that flaked perfectly. The beans and rice were decent and also had a good kick to them. Personally I don't think you need so many beans but I just left what I didn't want. The grilled zucchini was awesome because it felt so healthy. While traveling sometimes it is hard to get nice veggies so these seemed very fresh and made me happy. My fiance got the Catfish Po'Boy that came with fries and hush puppies. He said it was good, that the catfish itself had good flavor and the pickles on it really made the sandwich. He really liked the hush puppies and wish they had given him more. The fries were average. He was a little disappointed with the roll, but it was fine. Beside the Po'Boys and fish plates, you can get tacos or basket combos. Things can be grilled or fried. You can buy sides separately if you want to. Cost: Reasonable. My plate was $13.00 and my Fiance's Po'Boy was $12.25.  He got a beer and I got a diet soda. Our total was around $30 with the tip. You get plenty of food for the cost too, so they don't cheat you there. It wasn't the best meal I ever had but it was decent and a nice break from the BBQ. Like I said, I also appreciated the freshness of the fish and veggies. I'd tell people to try it out. I'm not sure I would go back, but only because there are so many other places to eat. Perhaps if I lived in the area I would try it again. I don't think you'd have a bad experience if you went, just don't go with the expectation you are going to be getting a gourmet meal!",3,175,72,276,1

They were under fried, soggy, and tasted 100% freezer burnt... I could only eat two because the taste was just horrible, even with dipping sauce. The fries that came along with the combo were also under fried, blonde, limp, and undercooked. The saving grace was that the hush puppies were actually moist and had good flavor. The snow crab platter all tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. They were so badly overcooked that the meat inside was shriveled and impossible to dislodge from the shell. Spent so much time trying to get out the very minimal amount of meat from the shells and was definitely not worst the effort or price. The new potatoes that came with the platter were mush and tasted like they were just sitting in water, and had zero flavor. Everything just tasted old. It was definitely disappointing :( Based on the other reviews, I had so much hope for this place and was really looking forward to a good meal. It just wasn't.

So  starting with the pasta, it was served room temperature but the regular meat sauce had a good flavor on the ravioli ( probably the Only thing we liked here) but it was cold.  so I wasn't satisfied and then we tried the chicken Alfredo pizza it was also cold, but it didn't taste like Alfredo they had more of like a barbecue chicken but it looked so delicious when it came out but again it was cold . And lastly My husband had Spanish with his Ravioli ( of course he's an Italian spinach lover) but It had a good taste for Spanish but because there was a piece of cardboard found in his Spanish we assumed it's frozen spinach, because fresh spinach shouldnt have the cardboard box in it . and they only made up For this mishap by offer us a free sweet tea ( I ordered one and they told me they would take care of it since this happened) so it was taken off the check and because of that was so disappointed .

The food is to die for - the toasted ravioli is phenomenal, the beacon salad dressing is my all time favorite, and the garlic rosemary chicken alfredo is my go-to comfort food. My boyfriend loves this place as much as I do. My mom does as well. Family favorite, if you can't tell. However, the last few times we've been to Pete and Sam's we have had the absolute WORST experience with who I believe is the owner (unsure). The first experience was relatively busy after a Memphis Tiger basketball game (and Pete and Sam's is usually busy on the weekends anyway), no biggie. We call ahead and get our name on the list but still expect a little wait. We get there and we're told around 30 mins by presumed owner, no worries. 30 mins goes by, and he's seating people who came in after us. 40 mins, same thing. This continues for an about an hour and 15 mins. He kept telling my boyfriend he was next but then proceeded to seat people ahead of us. When I went to ask him why we weren't being sat next, he was extremely rude to me and told me the parties were much bigger than ours (they weren't, I watched). Same thing happened last night. I went to eat with my dad and he did the same thing. What was supposed to be a 20-30 mins wait was over an hour until me and my dad were 1 of 2 parties left waiting. Continuously seating people ahead of us as they'd come in. I actually saw one guy walk in the door and the presumed owner called him by name & goes ""Come on!"" and walked him and his wife into the dining room to a table. I completely understand waiting for a table & I don't expect to be sat immediately, especially on weekend nights at a restaurant like that, but I don't expect to be treated like last choice for a table. I also don't expect such a callous disregard for the customers that you aren't best friends with.

It starts at the separate bar where the bartenders know how to get everyone served quickly without any backup, cheers.Next the seating for out large 20+ group happened within 5 minutes of our arrival which was impressive because some of outlrvtables were just emptying as we arrivef.Jesse was server at our table of eight and he got everything perfect from beginning to end plus he transitioned all our out bar tabs without a hitch. For the menu we had 4 entrees offered with four sides. The brought out plenty of baskets of bread with butter plus appetizers were pepperoni and barbeque pizzas which were excellent. For dinner my wife had the 6 ounce file mignon with ravioli and I had the veal parmesan with spaghetti and we were very pleased with our meal.Again the place was packed but everything ran extremely smooth and they never got behind or overwhelmed in the least.  Hats off to s very well run operation with top shelf people.

They did not take reservations before the fire but have started doing so since they reopened.  When we arrived at the time of our reservation, we were told that they were ""running behind"" on their reservations and that it would be about 30 minutes before we were seated.  Another customer came up to me and said he had been waiting 45 minutes since his reservation with no idea when he would actually get a table, so we left.  I asked the hostess what the point of having a reservation was if you had to wait at least 30 minutes for your table, and she shrugged her shoulders and said sometimes that ""just happens.""Considering our previous experience of waiting a very long time for our food after we ordered, we would have been there all night if we had not left.  If you have all the time in the world to kill while waiting for a table and then your food, this is your place.  It not, you might want to look elsewhere like we did.  It's clear now that the place I grew up with and loved was burned in the fire and is gone forever.  Very sad.",0,0,19,1,0

Our waitress handled our large group amazing since we didn't all show up at once. She was always on hand for anything we needed and was attentive of drink levels and refills.  We started with spinach dip which is always a good choice here served hot with a nice layer of fresh cheese on top. The chips served with it were delicious, cooked in house they were pulled straight from the frying oil straight to our table. Plus you get a side of salsa and sour cream always a nice addition! For my entree I ordered the Sunshine burger. Beef patty cooked to order with bacon, cheese, and topped with an egg. Typically my favorite burger on the menu but there's so many that I do tend to mix it up occasionally. Ordered a side of fries which is enough fries to split with another person.

Maybe I just don't think my words will give Huey's Midtown justice, but here goes...Huey's Midtown has the best dern veggie burger in America.  Yep. I said it.  I always get it with one slice of Swiss and one slice of cheddar.  I have yet to find a veggie burger to top Huey's in all of my travels around the globe. It's no surprise that Huey's usually wins the annual best burger surveys in Memphis. Despite Memphis' burger restaurant explosion, between 2015 and 2018, Huey's stands the test of time. They also have a pretty mean nacho dish.  Come with your appetite for that heaping meal.  It's delicious and filling. I usually get it with the chicken on top. They have a potato soup people come from all over town to gulp down. Their spinach dip is worth the calories. People also like the potato skins, fries and onion rings.  Their sweet tea is also on point. As far as atmosphere goes, expect a red and white checkered table feel and a bar that's in steady use. On Sundays, there's music.  They also have a trivia night and other fun stuff. So about those toothpick thingies in the ceiling.  You're encouraged to shoot them through your straw and at the end of the year, the person who guesses how many are in the ceiling gets a prize. This place is good for the kiddos in the daytime, it's also a late-night spot.  One of those places that never seems to close down. It's just a good old American restaurant and Memphis wouldn't be the same without this local chain. The Midtown location was the first of all the Huey's restaurants. It has personality and a festive environment.  It's a well-oiled machine and Memphis institution. You haven't really experienced Memphis, if you haven't been to Huey's.",0,74,12,0,0

My mother brought us here today after a visit to the zoo. She says this was the first Huey's and that her and my dad would eat here before I was born. Across the street on Tucker is the Goodwill store. 2 houses south of that was the house we lived in when I was a baby. Huey's must be doing something right to stay in business for that long and to grow across the city. They are doing something right, because they give you what you pay for, and they do it right every single time! And they do it at a good price. We really enjoyed our meal today, but we didn't enjoy our table. On the north wall, at the window for Madison, is a riser platform one step up. My family attempted to sit at the second table to the west, near the bathroom. We were quickly reprimanded and ordered to move because the server said they were short handed and were afraid they wouldn't see us. He even put up an old sign that said section closed on one side and smoking section on the other. I thought about just lighting up a cigarette. So we moved east near the door. Our table was not only wobbly, but the table top was loose so that it spun with the slightest touch. It took great concentration to keep the table still. Luckily there was nobody sitting behind us because the tables are squeezed in so tight, you nearly have to sit in somebody's lap. What pissed me off so bad, was that not 15 minutes after our party was ordered to move, there was another family sitting at the table we'd selected. Dammit Huey's, I'd have given you 5 stars had you not made me taint this review with such a stupid story! I ordered the Cuban. What a great sandwich!

Not much, but maybe just a bit. This is one of the oldest restaurants in Memphis and is a vital part of our city and its history. It's now the third generation. I did talk with Rudy for a minute after my meal and I was born the year he started this location. I do remember coming as a kid with my parents. I can't imagine what it would be like being stuck in the same building all those years doing the same thing every day. It takes a lot of work to stay open that long and I'm sure I'd get burned out. I'd never last this long. I was really wanting some lasagna, but I can have that every day. They are doing a meat and three deal, and offer different choices for each day. Wednesday is fried chicken, so I decided to do that not knowing what day my next visit will be. That fried chicken was nothing short of incredible. The skin and the breading really made it good. The pintos weren't special, but the stuffed potatoes and creamed corn were. And this time my partner and I were offered three breads, of which I only ate the cornbread. It's not iron skillet cornbread but it was good. Portion sizes were what I would expect for an adult and I ate every bit. I hope they know they ruined my dinner later that night. Some of the prices of the menu items are a tad bit high, but the daily special was very reasonable for what I got. I guess I had partly forgot about this place and haven't been in a while. I'll try not to let that happen again. I'm impressed by what I ate yesterday. Thanks guys.",0,155,2,0,0

For him, he got Chicken Parmesan with spaghetti on the side and for me, I got the Stuffed Jumbo Shells with ravioli on the side. Both of our dishes were robust in flavor from the gravy to the filling of the shells. For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu..one of my personal favorite desserts. It was prepared perfectly and was very delicious. They were very prompt with waiting times in between dishes, as well. We will definitely be back in the future! Thank you!!",0,0,1,0,0

So at lunch we get a to go order of lasagna and Italian sausage with spaghetti and tiramisu.  Garlic bread they gave us was only toasted on one side and inside the bag there was hair on the bread also hair on my lasagna. the tiramisu tasted like it had a lot of cinnamon in it which I don't recall tiramisu having cinnamon in it all. I have never seen so much chocolate coated on a tiramisu maybe a drizzle but usually it just dusted with Coco powder and as soon as you open it you smell the cinnamon. I think they may have accidentally dusted/dosed it with cinnamon and covered their mistake with choclate.,0,1,2,0,0

My husband and I come from Jonesboro, AR every few months to eat here, largely because I have celiac and it's got safe gluten free options. The food is delicious and the service is always perfect.But I had to take off one star because of tonight's meal. It was absolutely not good at all. As usual, service was great and our server was wonderful. We decided to deviate from our usual orders and got a pasta dish with braised beef, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and a wine sauce. What we got tasted UNBELIEVABLY strong like alcohol. I've had plenty of dishes cooked with wine, and I know when done correctly, the alcohol cooks off and there's no alcohol taste. This literally tasted like wine was just stirred in before serving. It was THAT STRONG. Not only that, but both of us actually got VERY buzzed pretty strongly from the alcohol in our food! Because of this, we had to sit in our car for a good hour after because neither of us were safe to drive the hour back home.I've ordered many wonderful dishes here and we will definitely come back. But I would never, ever get this dish--or any with a wine sauce--again. I shouldn't have gagged at the taste of alcohol in my dinner and definitely shouldn't have gotten actually drunk (we both did). We didn't complain because we just aren't that way. We understand things can happen, and chalked this up to an error on the chef's part. And it won't keep us from returning. Perhaps they were super busy and he rushed through cooking and didn't reduce the wine like they thought. But since this was my husband's early Mother's Day gift to me, it was disappointing to have pasta taste like alcohol and make us both drunk.My hope is the restaurant can see this and be aware that this happened, and maybe see to it that others aren't served pasta that makes them drunk.Edited review: I have edited and updated my review to be five stars. This is because the management gave me a call today about the situation, and they were incredibly nice and made it right for us. I will just chalk this one up to an honest mistake, because even the best restaurants can have an off night. I look forward to coming back soon",0,170,13,5,0

As vegetarians, it is difficult for my wife and I to find high end entrees that are vegetarian-friendly and Italian food is known for pastas that have lots of vegetables. We had a nice seat on the patio (even though you're watching cars maneuver in and out of the shopping center parking lot) and our waiter recommended a perfect red and white wine for us. Alas, time to order! Finally time to eat some great Italian food! I ordered the Capellini Toscana and my wife ordered the Manicotti Con Spinaci.Capellini Toscana: Where do I even start? When the food arrived, I was presented with a plain, lukewarm, bowl of overcooked pasta with assortment of boiled vegetables. The menu described a white wine and olive oil sauce in this pasta, yet when mine arrived it smelled bland and looked appalling. I still decided to taste it... literally had no flavor. No salt, no spice, no acid, no fat, and zero texture. This was by far the worst dish I have ever ordered and tasted at a restaurant in my life. Manicotti con Spinaci: I've tasted canned pasta sauce better than the sauce accompanying this dish. It tasted overly salty which made it difficult to taste anything else in the dish. Not much more to sayOverall, I am so disappointed in the food experience we had here. Our waiter was great and the manager listened when I told her about our concerns with our food.

Allow me to set the scene: Drinks and dinner at 5:30 p.m. before seeing a production at Theater Memphis. Four women. Right after leaving their corporate jobs. Ya with me?One friend orders a pomegranate martini. It arrives with no juice/mixer of any sort. It is pure Kettle One, Pomegranate flavor vodka. She asks for some juice to cut it with. The server insists on remaking it. The second attempt has juice now, but is extremely tart and tastes as if there is very little alcohol. Other friends order vodka/cranberry and a Seaglass Rose - Both of which are great. (the 4th opted not to drink alcohol).The menu was lacking to me. I don't prefer Italian Cuisine due to the overuse of Rosemary in most dishes. I loathe Rosemary with a wicked passion. I avoid it at all costs. Just like some people can't stand cilantro... that's me and Rosemary. I digress. Generally, places have menu items that can be built/configured with your choice of noodles, choice of sauce, etc. Still with me? Ciao Bella didn't have these options. I ended up ordering the Chicken Carbonara which was fantastic. Except for the rosemary. Thank you, wine, for handling the dish soap flavor of the world's worst herb.The others we pleased with the quality of their food. Service was passable. We didn't hate it, but it wasn't 100% pleasant either. The place wasn't crowded at the time we arrived, but had filled up by the time we left. The 3 stars are for the 3 who had a decent experience.

That's because it just isn't very good. We have had horrible service the last few meals. I didn't even get the dish I ordered last night and never saw our waitress to get it changed out. Had to get up and get our own drink refills. It smelled like a Tijuana fish market as some fish was obviously bad but still being served. My wife has a pizza she likes but I'm not sure why. Usually comes out cold like it did last night and is always super dry and pretty flavorless. I've had a few decent dishes but overall I'm just not a fan.

There is a sign out front prohibiting firearms from legally entering the building. -1 star. This Bella burger has a serious bun/meat ratio problem. The brioche bun was great, but it was way oversized. I love a burger patty this thick, but it was small in comparison to the entire loaf of bread it was served with. I would have been happy with a smaller bun. The beef was cooked on a flame, it was kinda dry and unspectacular. Not juicy at all. The tomatoes had no flavor at all. Not the worst tomatoes ever, but not good by any means. Why don't I deserve a nice leaf of lettuce? Why chop it up? Looks like a rabbit already chewed it for me. -1 star. The eggplant fries were awesome. That's the thing to try here. I'm just not sure if it works with the marinara sauce. Maybe some ranch would do the trick! I understand inflation and cost increases. I have no problem with price increases except for when I look at the online menu and see a Bella Burger advertised for $8 and arrive at the restaurant to see it is actually $10 on the printed menu. Not cool. The waitress mentioned that it was happy hour, but I assumed it was for beverages and didn't fully understand that happy hour is also for food. That made my burger and eggplant fries come out to $8.75 after tax! It was $4 off the ticket. I would have deducted a star for the false price advertising, but they sold it cheaper to me anyway. Now, if they can take $4 off a small ticket like this and still make enough profit to support their business while selling a decent meal, then does that mean that other businesses are making at least $4 extra profit on small meals like this? Or does this mean that perhaps they don't value the food they serve here and they realize it isn't worth the price they are asking? Or is this a sign of struggle to retain and attract customers? Either way, I did find the value to be pretty exceptional. The waitress said that happy hour is from 11am till 7pm sun-thurs. I think that's right. The server was incredible. This is a nice place. For me to give 5 stars, and I wouldn't mind paying full price, the sign out front denying our liberties would have to be removed, I would expect better lettuce and tomato, the bun could be smaller, and really it should come with cheese.",9,236,636,4487,1

I chose what I thought was beef ravioli, but found out it was cheese...little signs indicating which is which would be nice. The house salad was your typical mix, but the Italian dressing was good. Entree options were manicotti and (I think) chicken carbonara. Again, there were no labels indicating what the options were and it seemed odd to have two heavier choices mid-day. However, the manicotti was good- I just couldn't eat that much of it. Dessert was tiramisu or what appeared to be creme brulee cheesecake. The tiramisu may have been the best I've ever had- perfect espresso flavor without making the ladyfingers soggy and fluffy marscapone.Service was efficient and friendly.

It was the only thing that I ate and I was in my bathroom for the rest of the evening. This often happens with me when Accent is used, so I will attribute it to that.  However, it could have been anything.  I just know that it was something that had an overwhelming effect on my system.So, order their salad, or any other menu item, which I'm sure will be fine.  Just steer away from the lasagna if you have a propensity to be disturbed by ingredients!The atmosphere is lovely and the service is great.  Prices are a bit high, but you get  your money's worth.  Reservations are suggested as they are always busy.  It's truly worth a try for  yourself.  As for me, I just won't order the lasagna next time.",0,1,134,1,0

Outside of Ethiopian there is mostly African/Mediterranean style eateries. Bala's Bistro is a very unassuming spot near the corner of Raines and Airways. If you turn the corner too fast, you'll almost pass it. It's a basic little restaurant; clean and the counter helpers are lively. This is my second time eating from Bala's. I've not ever dined in, but I will at some point. The place is open from 4pm-10pm. This is awesome because any eatery with real, cooked food is already closed or is near closing at 8. So if you decide at 8:30pm that you want African food, you can get it. They also serve simple American food as well(wings, burgers, catfish). This is a good balance because of the demographics. It serves the people in the community and one day they may actually come in and try African food instead of ordering wings! I know the place is going to expand and include foods from other African countries. It will be welcomed. All the food was good. The first time I had the okra stew with seafood(basically seafood gumbo) with fufu. Their fufu is made from plantain instead of yam, so I wasn't expecting the taste, but with paired well. My mate had the lamb stew and saffron rice. He really liked it and was impressed with portion size.  This time I had what is in the photo. The spinach was a little salty, but with the sides I had, it balanced out. The hibiscus drink and the ginger drink are good, but too sweet.

Great tomato base, loaded with veggies.I had the catfish dinner with fried okra and seasoned fries. The catfish is some of the best I have found in the area, and there are a lot of places selling sub-par catfish. Not this place... proper amount of breading, great seasoning, and really fresh.  The fried okra are whole okra, battered and fried like the normal okra you're used to. I've never had okra that's not been chopped into small bites, but this works really well. Seasoned fries were good as well.The wife had the grilled bone-in lamb steak with jasmine rice and fried okra. The cost is well worth it, there is more than $15 worth of lamb - she had leftovers even after sharing with me. Seasoned well, juicy and cooked to perfection. Give this place a try!",6,178,146,120,0

I ordered my usual entree, the Frenchmen St. Filet. Every time I have ordered this in the past, the sauce always smothered my plate, which I love. Knowing this and knowing how much I enjoy the sauce, I asked for extra sauce on the side. When my to-go order came out, there was a minimal amount of sauce on my filet. The hostess stated that I would be charged for the extra sauce-- this confused me because they didn't even provide the usual amount of sauce I've ALWAYS received with my order. I asked to speak with the manager, and the manager came out immediately defensive. I showed him my plate and stated that this isn't even the standard amount of sauce that comes on it. He went back and forth with me on this. He even said they scaled back on the sauce for a more portioned meal. If I was informed beforehand (perhaps when I was placing my order), I could have decided to continue with my order as is, agree to the extra charge for added sauce, or not place the order at all. I was not informed of this change until I was told I'd be charged for more sauce. I ultimately requested my money back for my entree and said I would keep the other entree ordered for my friend. The manager was disrespectful and started bringing up all the starving people globally and why I was wrong for returning my entree. He even took it a step further to the point where he said, ""well, if you return one entree, you'll need to return the other entree too."" I did without hesitation! This manager acted like he was punishing me, when in fact, he lost a long time customer, who plans to spread this message across all my networks. I will never patronize Venice Kitchen.

They have new lighting fixtures which are very nice and clean like the rest of the décor.  It just feels a lot more open than it used to.  Major improvement.FOOD:I looked over the menu and there were really nice additions made to the menu.  One of my favorites, the Crawfish Rolls, were delicious.  The rolls weren't heavy with the breading and the filling was amazing.  I thought that I would be missing out on the mozzarella sticks just ordering the rolls.  I was proven wrong.  The filling give you a sense of cheese in the sauce and the dipping sauce that they have as the pairing is very nice.  I decided to be healthy today and order the salad as my main course and it was amazing.  The avocado was just right !  I tried the champagne vinaigrette.  I rather use the balsamic since the champagne was just a little bit bitter with lack of sweetness to it. I did have one take away.  The bruschetta... they changed the bruschetta.  Before, you would have at least four slices of thinly sliced toasted bread with diced tomato, goat cheese, with a nicely mixed balsamic that was rich and dark.  It was amazing.  Well, ordered their new ""Salmon bruschetta"".  It was two very thick slices of bread with shredded chunks of salmon on top with what appeared to be an aioli cream sauce on top with capers.  I wasn't really happy with this update.  I took one bite and immediately felt like I was eating an open-faced salmon sandwich.   It was not nearly what I expected.  The toast was very soft, as you'd expect since it is so thick.  I think that ""sandwich"" should be somewhere in the description for this item so that people know clearly, what they are in for.STAFF:You walk in seeing a staff in their uniform all black and the first person at the door is full of energy, ready to seat you.  Once seated, Samantha was our waitress.  You could tell that she was new but she is so polite.  Of course, it was heart wrenching to tell her that we didn't want the bruschetta but she took it well.  The manager, on the other hand, may not have been so thrilled.  He decided to come out and ask us what was wrong with the item and I explained it calmly.  Of course, giving bad news isn't going to be accepted with a smile and cheer.  He did everything he could, seeing if my friend who ordered the item would like to swap it out for something else (mind you this is a 12 dollar appetizer).  I think by how the conversation made her feel uncomfortable, she decided that she rather just take a discount off her ticket for the item.  Didn't want to chance that someone may be unhappy in the kitchen over the send back.  As great as the food was, the encounter made me a little uncomfortable with coming back myself. The way he came out from the back, you'd think I was being a...rude customer (can't use curse words) smh.   Now the spinach dip never disappoints but unfortunately I decided not to try any pizza.If I do decide to go back anytime soon... the crawfish rolls will definitely be my go to hands down.

It went wrong right off the bat - the fountain drinks from the bar were really off. Next came the Cioppino ‍, which was literally the worst cioppino I've ever had, and terribly lacking in seafood.  The Caesar salad was equally depressing, and almost as soupy as the cioppino.  At least they couldn't possibly mess up a margherita pizza, right? Wrong!  I would swear this frisbee came out of a vending machine. A lunch lady at elementary school wouldn't serve this to children, but they served it to my girlfriend with 1/2 thick tomato slices on it and absolutely no flavor.

Yelp was showing this restaurant as a 10 min drive from my hotel which was uber convenient. Now, I have become generally wary of Italian food in America, as having eaten my way thru various parts of Italy, on multiple visits, I have to confess to being an food snob, especially when it comes to Italian restaurants in the USA. However all the reviews for this place sounded really good, and so I decided to chance it, and am very glad I did! The restaurant when I entered only had x3 tables with patrons. After being seated by the only waitress/ hostess, to my surprise 5 mins later out strolled the chef from the kitchen door, walked over to my table and started chatting with and helped me with my order! Now how is that for service??I ended up getting the special Appetizer of the day cause I love Polenta and this was combined with mushrooms (another love) and gargonzola (yes, I love blue cheese too - can you detect a theme here?). The other thing I got from the regular menu was the Cioppino (Italian seafood soup). While waiting for my food, the waitress bought over some Bread and pesto gratis for the table and i just kicked back and relaxed while enjoying the lovely music playing in the background consisting of the Frank Sinatra songbook.I thought the Polenta dish was awesome-sauce! Really light and flavourful. The Cioppino was good, with lovely depth of flavour in the stock, but I wanted more white fish pieces and ended up getting heaps more salmon. I wouldnt mind getting either of these dishes again, however for the Cioppino, I would def ask for less pasta and no cheese.There was enough room left in my tummy to get some Creme Brûlée for dessert. This was overall nice but the sugar topping in one part was too burnt and that taste had also permeated into the creme and tasted really funky.Overall enjoyed my meal here, recommend and will return when next back in Memphis!Yelp Review 76/2018",6,467,1684,7515,0

The Shrimp and Lobster with angel hair spaghetti was absolutely delicious as the sauces, spices and herbs came together like culinary poetry. The best part?

Beautifully arranged -- the olive oil herb dip? Exceptionally tasted great.

We enjoyed the service, the bread, the decor, and the plates, but the food was honestly just not what we hoped for. Our waitress, Alex, was awesome and let us sub in angel hair pasta on both our dishes. And the bread and pesto was ridiculously awesome, but our meals were not. We got the Chicken Alfredo and the Pollo al Diablo. The alfredo was bland and the diablo was overpowered. We also got the cheesecake, which I thought actually tasted better without the fruit. Maybe this is how Italian food is supposed to taste. We are not sure and we don't know. But if so then I guess it's just not our thing.

I went to LB the other morning for a baggette. It was too early and they said to come back at 11am, which is fine.  I've never had an issue with the food there. What is troubling is service. The young ladies who have been hired on and off have zero social skills and act as if you are disturbing them with your business.  The other issue is that, when I went in (around 9am) is that the trash was overflowing. I mean it was packed in tight and smelled. It obviously had not been taken out the day before. As I was making my coffee I also observed that the tray with creamer, lemons etc., had been out all night as well.  Not cold, and the lemons were dry. The reason I bring up these things is because if they are willing to let the things up front be unsanitary what must it be like in the back?My guess is again, these new hires just aren't doing their job.Please, owners, fix this.  I love your restaurant.  I don't want you to fail because of bad hires.",0,15,36,2,0

Then a lemon tart and a bacon egg croissant. The croissants are HUGE! Like the size of a full grown man's hand huge. They were super fluffy and soft.

Their sweet tea tasted so different from what we're used to in Chicago. You can really taste how homemade it is. The sides complimented their chicken as well. I was impressed with their coleslaw and beans. Don't forget to end your meal with their fried pies and top it off with vanilla ice cream.

The sauce itself also felt a tad too fatty to me. The sides were alright, I had potato salad and coleslaw. The coleslaw I want to say is probably better than a lot of other stores (and I am not even a fan of coleslaw in general myself) but it had a good mix of sweet and sourness. As for the nachos, I think it was smothered in cheese. It was hard to appreciate the meat or the flavors because the cheese had been over-powering.

Judging from the brick-hard baguette I was served on my first visit and the bland, plastic-bag-quality soft bread every person in the place was served on my second, these guys either haven't perfected that art yet, or they think you won't notice or care. If you've loved this place for decades like most of us, you will notice. And you will care. There's a handful of other things I could complain about, but ultimately they'd all be meaningless if the menu delivered like it did for so many years. I won't give up hope, and I'll be delighted on the day I get to raise this review to five stars. I'm sure the breakfast is fine. But with what appears to be a 100% turnover in staff, I just wish they'd worked on re-perfecting what was already perfect about this place before getting ambitious enough to introduce an entirely new AM menu that everyone also needs to be trained on and prepped for. But I guess sticking to the same old, popular, successful, boring, legendary thing isn't what visionary chefs do. Dang shame.",7,8,55,188,1

It didn't give off a grocery store old finos vibe even though we were in the same OG building. They took down the original menu and made a plastic one. Ok..Now. To the food. It was bland. Generous amount of meats and cheese. But the BEST part was the flavor which had NONE. The tomato onion marinade was covered in Italian seasoning.

I sit down and the bread is hard as rock. It actually made a noise when I tapped on it with my nails... anyways I ask the cashier if the bread is typically tough and he mentioned there was another soft bread, but that their sandwich bread is supposed to be hard... his colleague agreed. Okay, what? Anyways, I tell him I just had mouth surgery last week so I was struggling with the hard bread. He mentions I could have ordered ""soft bread"" but did not offer to give me a slice... nor was I informed that my sandwich bread would be like eating a hockey puck and given that option originally. Common sense would lead anyone of the many employees to intercept this and correct the bad customer service. Anyone could see at this point that I'm just eating the ingredients out of the sandwich. I ended up throwing most of my meal away as I honestly thought it was one of the worst sandwiches I'd ever had. How is a sandwich even bad?! I didn't think that was possible. The coppa had a terrible flavor and the hams flavor was no flavor. The flavor was just... nothing. The cheese tasted like... air... water.... paper... whatever nothing tastes like.

The place was popular for other sandwiches as well, but I thought many items were so, so. Now that Chef Kelly runs the show, he sacrificed extreme quality fixation for actual good tasting food. I've tried the ""new"" Finos twice now. Both times were disappointing. Not for quality, but for taste.

However, if you want to say you're not going to change anything and that Fino's will be the same as before you need to do that. This is not Fino's, and I will tell you why:1. I got the Penn Station sandwich which was a staple of mine before they closed. The bread, while it looks the same, was hard as a rock. Not even the good crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. I got a jaw workout eating my sandwich. I will say there was a decent amount of meat, but the tomato onion dressing was bland and didn't provide any extra flavor like it used to. Also, explain to me why my sandwich came in a to go box. Old Fino's simply wrapped the sandwich. Now I understand why so many people were probably complaining about not having enough filling on their sandwich. You substituted quality and quantity for packaging that wasn't needed and simply wasteful. 2. I got a small pasta salad. Back in the day I was obsessed with their pasta salad. Got it every time I went. However, whatever they were passing off as pasta salad today was bland and smushy. There were three or so black olives in the mix and no seasoning what so ever. It was bland and disgusting and the only reason I ate it was because I paid for it and was hungry. Also old Fino's they gave my pasta salad to me when I got my sandwich. When I got my snadwhich I was confused and asked where it was, to which to girl behind the counter told me oh it's in the cooler with the other groceries. The cooler that is not labeled. In a container that I know is what most of that price I paid was paying for. Guess you substituted good food for pretty packaging... again...3. The staff was rude and not at all helpful. The girl taking my order could barely do that, and didn't tell me where to get my cup for my drink. I would understand this if you were 6 months in to a reopen instead of 1-2. Old Fino's didn't run like this and if you want to keep the name and say it's the same then help your customers out on where to get their drinks, and apparently sides as I found out later in my experience. Needless to say, I won't go back, and maybe that won't hurt his bottom.

I would like to start off by saying that Fino's has never been incredible. It was just pretty good for Memphis. Now, it's just pretty bad.First time back was their second day open, so I was not too surprised at the quality of my sandwich. I got the South Philly, which is basically my usual order. There was no lettuce on my sandwich and maybe a quarter piece of tomato on each half, not to mention the onion was just in random chunks that fall off the sandwich as soon as you pick it up. However, the worse part is there was a small chunk of bone in the ham that I bit down on. Luckily for them this happened to me and not someone else who could have possibly gone back in and made it a huge deal. I understand how these things happen. My second time back I got the same thing. Much better this time, however they put provel cheese on the sandwich and not provolone. It seemed like a mistake made by an employee who had not been trained, so I blame Kelly English for that one. Also, provel cheese is shitty.Next time I went, my sandwich was completely fine. Not great, not terrible but fine. The next two times I went I got breakfast. The breakfast is good. Just basic breakfast sandwiches that nobody else in town does. Nothing fancy but a good cheap breakfast sandwich. I am only speaking for the New York, which is the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. It would be hard to screw that up, but i'm sure they could do it. My latest experience, and possibly my last, was the worse so far. I got the same sandwich once again. This time it came complete with brown lettuce, chunks of white tomato and chunks of onion. Not nicely cut pieces but shitty chunks. Not to mention it wasn't even the tomato/onion dressing, it was just pieces of tomato and onion. It looked like it had been cut my someone who had never even heard of a knife. The sandwich was dry as hell, there was no dressing or anything whatsoever on it. Super disappointing. The coppa had the funkiest taste to it. I understand that this meat usually has a little funk to it, but this sandwich straight up stunk. I took it apart and the coppa was turning brown like it was going bad. It was actually inedible. The ham on the sandwich was fresh, but it wasn't great. It tasted like regular ass deli meat from the grocery store. I seriously feel like the ingredients have changed even since the first day they opened back up. I don't know if Kelly English really cares about this place or if he just thinks people will still come in since it's got a following. I think if Kelly English ate a sandwich as shitty as all the ones i've had from them he would be pissed, but I don't know. I really don't think I will be going back.

They used to have one of the best pizza's in town. The only problem is that they changed the crust. Why Kelly, why?!?! It used to be a thin, cracker-type crust. It has now been switched out for a more hand-tossed style of crust. The best way to describe it is super dense, and the pizza was oozing sauce to the point where I had to scrape the excess sauce away.I will go back in to try the sandwiches, but will unfortunately forego the pizza for a while. In the meantime I will pray that they return to the original crust they have used since the original Finos on the Hill  opened, especially since we were told nothing would change.Also, on a side note.

It's a small plate so it wasn't super filling but the flavors were amazing. Great BBQ tones but not too much to overpower the shrimp. The grits were perfection.  Served with fresh hot biscuits.

For entree I had Sweet Potato Crusted Catfish. The dish was well-presented, and tasted good except they overdid the mustard just a tad, to the point my eyes watered a couple of times. Didn't stop me from eating every mouthful.  Dessert was Banana Cream Pie, which even though I was almost stuffed full, I devoured every delicious mouthful. It wasn't sickly sweet, but was creamy and fruity with a nice short pastry. The atmosphere was easy to sink into, and loud though it was; it was just a fun place to be in a city so far from home.

The same scenario with the beef pho dish. Flavors were bold and balanced but the meat itself was again, inedible.",0,34,279,327,1

It's so popular, they can run out of their delicious beer grain toast.  On Sundays, they have chicken and waffles and other special menus. Went to brunch for the first time and got the egg and cheddar on a biscuit with a side salad.  Our plates looked like we licked them.  Their house dressing is so good I could drink it. I also tried the Blueberry Bramble with vodka instead of gin, and I had a Caramel Cortado.  The blueberry drink is so good, it almost tastes like a sort of blueberry-ade.  The Cortado reminds me of the strong coffee you get in Europe.

Here are mine:Our ""French Toast Waffle"" is served with a house made raspberry/maple syrup that is included in the cost of the dish - even if you want extra. We don't actually offer maple syrup on it's own - as the pure maple syrup that we use costs nearly $70/gal and, yes, we have to charge for it ($1.75). As for our mimosa - it's 9oz in total and we serve it over ice in a pint glass. If you requested ""no ice"" it comes in an oversized champagne flute - still 7oz champagne and 2oz fresh squeezed FL O.J. ""Expensive"" is relative to one's circumstances - but your accusation of ""Overpriced"" is simply false. All of our dishes and offerings are meticulously considered and prices are set according to my costs and overhead. I pay my cherished staff well, we work very hard, as do our vendors.

One great thing was that the staff were most accommodating, especially when more people showed up then expected. A lot has been said about the name of the restaurant and how the decor is like the inside of the bank so I won't say anything more, except to add that the chairs were a bit tough on my tushie after we were sitting on them for more than an hour. Also as it got more busier towards lunch hours, the noise level in the restaurant got amplified and it was harder to talk to table mates sitting a few chairs down from me.Since it was a brunch menu, I decided to get the Eggs Sardu with Hollandaise sauce. I hadn't ever heard of this dish before and when I googled it, discovered the origins are Louisiana Creole and at its base it's like Eggs Benedict (hollandaise sauce & poached eggs) with the addition of creamed spinach and artichokes, and then Chefs can put on their own personal spin, which for the Vault was the addition of bacon.Now I'm a big fan of poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce. With this Sardou dish, while I didn't mind the addition of the creamed spinach, for me the Artichokes did nothing for the taste levels, except add some unnecessary sourness. So overall wasn't a fan of this dish but their other menu items did look interesting, so wouldn't mind coming back. So my final verdict is that it was decent food and service but the noise level gets too loud if you want to converse with your co-diners.Yelp 142/2017",3,467,1684,7515,0

They charge $5 to park back there on the weekend Friday-Sunday. I did not know this because when I walked directly past her the first time she was yelling at some other people and I didn't see the sign she was standing in front of. When I came back to my car from eating I was rudely yelled at by this lady to pay my money. Then I called the restaurant to talk to the manager and let him know and he basically told me that's what they pay her to do: be rude to people because people don't like to pay. Okay so I will NOT be going back to Cafe Ole because that's how they feel it is okay to treat their customers. I hope that measly $5 you got is worth it.,0,79,1,0,0

So add that up, and we had been waiting 40+ mins on apps and drinks. While eating our apps, we see our waitress go out to the patio numerous times, at least 5-6, to serve those customers but NEVER check on us. We had to get another waitress to let our waitress know that we needed her AND SHE STILL took her time coming to see what we needed. My better half had their shrimp and grits & I had the Smoked Chicken Burrito. The shrimp must have been the only thing that were worth eating to her because after a few spoonfuls of the dish, she ate the shrimp and left the grits. On my burrito, I told them to keep the sour cream & beans. When the burrito came to the table, it looked like a frozen burrito that you buy from Walmart, FOR 13 BUCKS.

It is owned by the family that used to own the Knickerbocker, and I believe they are related to someone from Big Star, hence the fabulous Big Star memorabilia.On my visit last week for Prime Rib Monday, you can tell that there are regulars. Though I hadn't been in years, I ran into several friends from different areas of my lift. The décor resembles a pub turned restaurant with dark wood and low lighting in the bar area. Service was friendly and attentive. Our waitress encouraged us to place our order rather quickly to get in ahead of a very large party seated across the room from us. We appreciated her counsel. Our salads came out quickly and were fresh and a nice size. Given the fact that we were taking advantage of the Prime Rib, we shouldn't have ordered an appetizer, but we did. The lure of fried pickles was too much to resist. We should have resisted. The batter was too thick for our taste. The Prime Rib was a generous portion served at the requested temperatures.

We had not been to Mortimer's in a couple of years and decided to go back for a Friday night dinner. After reviewing their menu online, we had decided to order the trout amandine described on the website. We arrived around 5:30 and there was no one in the place except at the bar. There appeared to be way more wait staff & employees than customers, so it was surprising that the service was so slow. We ordered drinks, then waited a long time to turn in our food orders. When the waiter came to take our orders, we inquired as to why the trout listed on the online menu wasn't on the menu in the restaurant. He told us that the online menu was an old menu and that ""someone needs to update that."" We ordered the clam chowder, grouper and salmon. A few minutes later, he came out to tell us they were out of clam chowder. So we chose the French onion soup, instead. The soup came out first. It was definitely canned French onion soup over a slice of loaf bread with some melted cheese on top. Pretty sad and overly salty. But the biggest disappointment were the entrees. The salads were iceberg lettuce with cheddar cheese & croutons. No tomato or other ingredients. Then, the grouper was clearly talapia, not grouper. It appeared to be a piece of frozen fish that had been heated. It was accompanied by frozen French fries. The salmon was greasy and sprinkled with some sort of rub that made it salty. For dessert, we ordered the lemon ice box pie, which was clearly a frozen pie that was bland and tasteless.

About halfway through our meal, I look up and see that a third staff member has come into the kitchen area. Not only was he not wearing a mask, but he was wiping his nose, not washing his hands afterward (he wiped his hand on his jeans) and then he was handling a tray of food to put into the oven; it may have been bread, but I'm not sure. I understand that in small kitchen spaces it's difficult to maintain the 6ft distance but, in addition to this employee not wearing a mask, the chef took his off and they engaged in conversation within a foot of each other.

We watched the cooks all join in a line outside the office, and it looked like they were reviewing the security footage of the fight instead of cooking orders.  My tenders came out a little burnt and they forgot to throw in the cup of Ubee's sauce which comes standard 1 per order or tenders, which is a bummer because that sauce is fire.Basically, management here has no idea what they're doing, but the food is good for bar food at 2:30 in the morning.",0,2,25,0,0

It's a creamier pale ale, and absolutely delicious! My partner ordered a Memphis Made Fireside on tap which never disappoints! Taryn quickly grabbed our beers behind the bar. They were served with the perfect amount of head and chilled in a frosty glass beer mug. I was suprised that the beer stayed cold for almost 30 minutes!  We ordered the Bardog Poo Poo platter that is an assortment of shrimp skewers, pork & veggie egg rolls, crab rangoon,buffalo chicken tenders, and shoestring fries. Each appetizer was just okay with the crab rangoon being my least favorite and the egg rolls being the best on the platter.

As you enter there's what looks like a big old wood bar and across the front of the room, by the windows to the street,  a row of backed stools with a shelf for drinks and a row of tables against the wall with padded booth on one side and chairs in the other. There's bottles and paraphernalia covering 15' wall behind the bar that is a welcoming atmosphere whether you're here to enjoy a little food and or have a drink. The seating is packed upstairs with the bar jammed with lots of cheery faces, Lynyrd Skynyrd blasting on the overhead speakers and lots of people laughing and talking real loud. (if you want intimate or subdued it's not here) The music selection has put me in a good mood with Dobbie Brothers, Steely Dan and more of  TV's at both ends of the upstairs that have the Lakers playing on one & ESPN on the other. (turning on captioning wouldn't hurt) My take is that this is a  good place to relax in a friendly setting where they make feel welcome.They take the ""bar"" in their name seriously with a fully stocked bar that features a good selection of regional beers and special mixed drinks right down to some bubbly choices. I posted pics of board specials highlighting some of those as well as menu offerings. Even though I'm not a big drinker these days I certainly can appreciate what it takes to be a really great bar and this is it. However I'm here for some late night food and unlike others in the area that offer a very scaled down menu the full selection is available. Before I dive into the menu I see special #1 is Grilled snapper with new potatoes & veggie medley Special #2 is a meatloaf with lettuce & spicy ketchup. Also on the ""board"" actually a big mirror, is Beer Cheese Soup, 10"" all beef with pineapple pico, Mussels with white wine, garlic, butter & tomatoes, Turkey melt in wheatberry with lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado & spicy mayo and the daily special dessert Salted caramel. I check the menu and settle on the Monster vegetarian burrito (they offer chicken & shrimp add-ons for extra) and for $3.79 I also order one (1) slider with fries. (no judging vegans:-) Wow!! The burrito is, hot & fresh, jammed with beans & veggies that I sliced into four sections and had to use a fork on most of it. There's sour cream and the salsa is really great. This is, hands down, my favorite hot veggie burrito anywhere and I am a big veggie burrito fan! The picture is deceiving because it's even bigger than it looks because I was super full. The sliders here are the real deal too because they are fatty fresh butter patties that have an excellent season & cook with a special homemade mayo on the side. The fries are crispy shoestrings that may be frozen but don't taste it. I totally enjoyed my meal from beginning to end and it's not my first visit and will not be my last. Best late night food, period! Hannah is a excellent server who, like all great servers, smiles and makes you feel at home even though she really busy. She was there for my drink even before I knew I needed a refill and always made sure that I was happy. I also got a ""have a good night"" farewell, & finally it always feel good to feel good about a leaving a well deserved generous tip. All things considered it's no wonder there's multiple awards on the wall, tastefully displayed on the way to the bathrooms, and yes the bathroom is clean. Actually everything that I've seen here is clean well maintained. Bottom line. Whether you want to dress down and head here to unwind after a long day at the office or you're just passing through this is a great place to have a drink or get a snack or full blown lunch or dinner. No matter what you are thinking, bar food like wings or Mom's NJ meatballs or one of their staples like the truly special fresh & juicy sliders, a good pasta dish or choice steak dinner or maybe one of the daily specials that are a cut above some of the more ""upscale"" establishments in the metro Memphis, this place checks all the boxes . It's another 5+ star destination that you'll be glad you tried. Final note: Don't forget their talked about &  award winning brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.",13,1040,885,7495,1

If you're with a group of girls or you are a woman, DO NOT GO TO BARDOG. They do not care about your safety until it's too late. We went with a large group of friends, a mix of girls and guys. This random at the bar (I have attached a photo of him winking at us, I also have an extended video that I will try to post on google or facebook) decided to make his goal of the night to make us uncomfortable. admitted to noticing him staring and winking at us. In the video, one of the girls calls him out for staring and states that we've asked him multiple times to stop and he says that we didn't call him out x amount of times, but actually y ( I believe 5 or 6) amount of times. He turned his entire body away from his friends and the bar to stare at our group. He grabbed one of our friend's butt TWICE. We informed the bar manager and other employees but they did nothing as their policy apparently is that they ""have to see something happen"", even though one of the waitresses later Only after our friend yelled at him in front of everyone did security step in, but all they did was move him to the other side of the bar. How sad that a bar prioritizes a creep's money over the safety and comfort of other paying customers.  You would think that being told that someone grabbed a customer without their consent would be enough to get kicked out of a bar, but not at bardog! So, if you're a creep with a loaded wallet, come make Bardog your new stomping grounds! They'll welcome you with open arms and bartenders sassing your victims as they leave.",1,68,165,19,0

I was there celebrating my birthday with my wife and six of our closest friends so we were a party of eight people on four separate checks.We were challenged when we went to pay the bill because two of us at the table had a coupon and their policy only allows one coupon per table which is kind of crappy because we had four checks with our party of eight. I understand policy and certainly do everything I can to follow it however when I asked Nick to make an exception to this he simply stated and kept stating the policy to me.

I dealt with 3 of them in total and they all went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Our main server in particular went above and beyond to make sure my nephew (who had a severe dairy protein and peanut allergy) had food he could eat and even went so far as to bake a special loaf of bread without cheese. The food was excellent. I had macadamia encrusted Mahi Mahi with mixed veggies. The fish was exactly what I wanted. The veggies were not great, but I will switch my side next time.

They have the best, most crisp, fresh as you can get, natural/organic items to go in or on the salad, and the homemade dressings are out of this world. I build my own salad only because I'm a bougie queen.. then at the end they ask if you want your salad chopped!! I know I know I was so in awe as well! I know.. I know just thank me later after you finish off one of their massive salads and center yourself around a good nap! Any time at all my friend is like J. Want to run and I'm like yeah. We run straight to this amazing restaurant. Also the staff know everything about their products so no question is too much for them! It's also super clean and they have a nice deck on the side under some huge shade trees.. where you can enjoy a nice lunch/brunch if you will!",0,24,3,0,0

It's my favorite place to get a salad in town. When you come into the restaurant, you order at the counter. They have a variety of salad and sandwich options, or you can make your own from any of the ingredients they have out at the salad bar. I recommend the Santa Fe salad - it has black bean, corn, tomatoes, and chicken with a buttermilk ranch dressing. You also have the option to get the salad chopped with dressing mixed in. Always do this!! I don't like bug chunks of lettuce in my salad, and by chopping up all the ingredients, i don't get that. They can then mix the dressing into the salad in a big bowl, which is way better than me trying to mix in dressing with my fork.

Strong honey drink Food: I believe it's their ""country breakfast"" (could be wrong, been a while since I went due to covid) and it comes with everything you would want for brunch - thick cut bacon, biscuits and gravy, hashbrown casserole, eggs, and I think sausage too. It was delicious and a huge portion of food. Also recommend their shrimp and grits. Only negative was a dinner experience we had for a birthday - had reservations and they sat our fairly large group right behind the bar, and bar patrons kept standing up in groups and pushing onto our seats. Management should have said something because it was quite obvious that they weren't being respectful of personal space and made all of us feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable. We asked our server to ask them to go back to their seats but nothing came out of it. Our server also forgot a lot of things and was kind of all over the place that night (keep in mind there were only 3 tables in the entire place other than ours). I get that having regulars is important, as are drink sales, but if it comes at the cost of earning the love and respect of new customers (possibly new regular), then management should be making everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Food and drinks are on point but service could be much better.",10,20,426,2589,1

When the Cheese came it had 4 different types of cheeses - there was a green pesto one that I didn't like but the rest of the selection was more palatable and then there was some forgettable pieces of olives, artichokes, pecans and of course the obsequious crackers.A few folks also got drinks and when the bill came, were a bit surprised at the prices - I thought my cheese plate could have been more innovative too.

The sushi rice was terrible. I think the spring rolls are frozen. I have had a few things that were pretty good, but lots of things that were terrible. The bottom line here is that there is too much on the menu to do anything very good. I find this to be the case when the ethnicity of the workers doesn't match that of the food. This crazy pay to park thing pushed me over the edge along with more bad food. I'm done here. The Tom Yum soup was amazing, but I found the quality of the sashimi fish to be far less than I expected. Service was a little odd too, as it seems that this is an Asian restaurant staffed predominantly by Americans who really don't know much about the food they are serving, it's ingredients, or the culture. I'm still trying to figure out how this is a ""bistro"". It isn't small, it isn't a cafe, it is far from European, and the foods aren't necessarily simple dishes. Starting with the menu, there is a lot to choose from and for those of us who like to consider all our options, making a choice could be quite a project. It is however impressive how many choices there are. Aside from the main menu there was a lunch menu and a drink menu. With that many choices, it seems like you could get anything you wanted. I was in the mood for the one thing they did not have. I wanted a stir fried squid. They don't have it. I have found at other restaurants that businesses who offer too many choices are not as good at some things as others. Sometimes it's best to only offer the things they really excel at. I left a tip listing the choices I made from pictures, but decided to do things a little differently today. The Tom Yum soup was really excellent and I'll probably get it again. I ordered it with shrimp and I was pleased with the size, quality, and amount of shrimp for the price. Aside from that, the flavor was spot on. The lemon and lime and galangal came together with the spicyness just right, although I felt it could have used more chili pepper. There was no hot sauce on any of the tables. The waitress bringing it to me asked if I wanted crispy wontons. I thought it was odd she didn't just serve them. It was also odd that she brought two sauces with them that had nothing to do with the soup. Their fryer oil was oxidized and needed filtering because the fried crunchies had the taste of old oil. The soup came fairly quick, but it took forever to get my bento box. A long wait for such a simple dish. It should have been served with two dumplings because it made that portion of the plate look empty. I think the dumplings and egg rolls are frozen pre made. Not that great. As for the fish, I just didn't trust it, so I left most of it behind. The red tuna was pretty good. The salmon most definitely appeared to be a low grade farmed fish and had fatty content near the skin that should have been trimmed for sashimi. I'm sure it's been treated with carbon monoxide to enhance the color. I just couldn't help thinking that the yellowfin or white tuna or whatever it was could have been escolar, so I left that behind as well. Also, the fish didn't seem to have been stored below 40*.

Service was a little odd too, as it seems that this is an Asian restaurant staffed predominantly by Americans who really don't know much about the food they are serving, it's ingredients, or the culture. I'm still trying to figure out how this is a ""bistro"". It isn't small, it isn't a cafe, it is far from European, and the foods aren't necessarily simple dishes. Starting with the menu, there is a lot to choose from and for those of us who like to consider all our options, making a choice could be quite a project. It is however impressive how many choices there are. Aside from the main menu there was a lunch menu and a drink menu. With that many choices, it seems like you could get anything you wanted. I was in the mood for the one thing they did not have. I wanted a stir fried squid. They don't have it. I have found at other restaurants that businesses who offer too many choices are not as good at some things as others. Sometimes it's best to only offer the things they really excel at. I left a tip listing the choices I made from pictures, but decided to do things a little differently today. The Tom Yum soup was really excellent and I'll probably get it again. I ordered it with shrimp and I was pleased with the size, quality, and amount of shrimp for the price. Aside from that, the flavor was spot on. The lemon and lime and galangal came together with the spicyness just right, although I felt it could have used more chili pepper. There was no hot sauce on any of the tables. The waitress bringing it to me asked if I wanted crispy wontons. I thought it was odd she didn't just serve them. It was also odd that she brought two sauces with them that had nothing to do with the soup. Their fryer oil was oxidized and needed filtering because the fried crunchies had the taste of old oil. The soup came fairly quick, but it took forever to get my bento box. A long wait for such a simple dish. It should have been served with two dumplings because it made that portion of the plate look empty. I think the dumplings and egg rolls are frozen pre made. Not that great. As for the fish, I just didn't trust it, so I left most of it behind. The red tuna was pretty good. The salmon most definitely appeared to be a low grade farmed fish and had fatty content near the skin that should have been trimmed for sashimi. I'm sure it's been treated with carbon monoxide to enhance the color. I just couldn't help thinking that the yellowfin or white tuna or whatever it was could have been escolar, so I left that behind as well. Also, the fish didn't seem to have been stored below 40*. It was too warm to be safe. For the record, the name Mao should not be anywhere on a menu in any kind of way that would honor this brutal dictator. I consider this an insult to China and to the world.",0,0,2,0,0

Typical buffet style as far as freshness and temperature go.  Everything else I had was delicious.  They have a different type of item every weekday. If you like chicken and dumplings, come on a Wednesday. i had them when I was here a few years ago and they were SOOOOO good.  Unfortunately, you can only get them on the buffet or through a catering order.  They should put them on the regular menu.  Yum, yum, yum! This location has a different feel than the Germantown one.  I liked the food here better, if only because the chicken and beef were really good.  The place is old. It's somewhat run-down. It has the same feel as when I came here in college 20 years ago.  Perfect diner style. Great staff. Parking can be a nightmare in this area.",0,13,97,38,0

Period. The restaurant exists solely to support its noble mission of community outreach.Now on to the review:Caritas Village is unassuming. The building itself looks like an old church or schoolhouse and, for all I know, it was. But upon arrival, you begin to notice the beautiful art that spans the walls and the gardens planted by children with messages of ""Hope,"" ""Friendship,"" and ""Trust"" among others.The artists' canvas extends into the dining room where you immediately notice vibrant paintings and sketches spanning the walls. A friendly greeting from the cashier adds a voice to the warmth felt on the inside.On my first and only visit so far, I ordered the Osho burger, a beef patty between toasted buns with provolone, caramelized onions and bacon served with an optional tomato and lettuce on the side so you can say you had some vegetables with your meal.It was excellent. The fact that the burger plus chips and a water to drink only costed me $7.50 did not hurt either.My girlfriend ordered the chicken schwarma. I cannot truly speak to the quality of her meal as she only afforded me a tiny yet tasty bite. I believe the lack of generosity speaks volumes as to the quality of her dish.

There were orders of medium-rare, medium, medium-well, and well at our table.  All were perfect.  Typically when I order a hamburger medium-rare, I'll get the suburban medium-rare, which is more like a medium (over-cooked).  This was spot-on, perfectly executed. It comes on beautiful bun that's given love on the flat-top or grill and brushed with butter. Then the patty, hand formed, and larger than the bun by at least a half-inch all the way around.  The meat is perfectly seasoned and about the juiciest I've ever had on a burger.  This is the largest single patty burger I've had in town.  The Bing burger comes with caramelized onions, tomato, romaine leaf and cheese (I want to say there were choices, cheddar, swiss, American, but it was really unimportant because the meat was the star).   Only complaint was my bun was soggy towards the end, but that didn't seem to be a problem for my less adventurous lunch mates who had their's a little more done.  Even if it were soggy the whole time, it would still be one of the top burgers in town, it's that good.A huge burger, pickle spear, and scoop of potato salad for $5.75.  And I didn't eat dinner that night.  Ridiculous value.  Tip well, it all goes to an excellent cause.

I'd think, as our server, you'd care, but maybe not. We literally had to flag the woman down for this snark. No apology. No, ""can I bring you something while you wait?"" etc. When our entrees finally arrived, the expo who did run our food auctioned it off like it was Chili's. ""WHO HAS THE LAMB CHOPS???"" Ma'am.

Both of our meals were very good and presented very nicely. For dessert the waitress suggested the Creme brûlée, which is my favorite. She told us to get one to share.

It is definitely an antique/ old school vibe from the plaid table clothes to the cash register. I went for lunch. I was on the hunt for some Lasagna and I found it here! They had a lunch special for $8.50 that included bread, salad, and of course, Lasagna! The Lasagna was good. However, I could tell that it probably was the last batch of the lunch special. Although it taste good (I know the picture does it no justice), but it was a little tough around the edges and the sauce was dried throughout the slice. The salad and bread was fresh. The homemade Italian dressing was really good as well. I will be back to try it again. Maybe I will go a little early next time.",0,92,182,23,1

Just so you are aware, this is not a food review, as we never got to sample any. But no matter how wonderful the food may be, the disaster that awaits you, dear reader, it is a true story. ;-)First, let's talk about what went right. We were sat almost immediately. They got us water and even brought extra lemons, which is a real winner with my wife. Then, at 7:30 PM we ordered Chicken Parmesan and Ravioli (two dishes). I also ordered a glass of Chianti (cause who doesn't like liver, fava beans, and a nice Chianti? - Hopefully everyone gets the reference). Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. At 8:30 PM we left. No chianti. No bread for the table. No Chicken Parmesan or Ravioli either. Wait, I know what you are thinking. We did not talk to anyone. Nay, day reader. We talked to everyone that worked there that came by. I ordered my Chianti at least 3 times. And, twice, we were told our order was next. Finally a lady with keys, which just screamed manager. She told us things were busy, but she would go check. That was 15 minutes before we gave up. At least now I understand why they are open until 1 AM. It increases the chance the poor diner might actually eat.Coletta's has an interesting system. You do not have a server, you have all of them. They all work the floor. This means you can equally be ignored by multiple people. Or brushed off after being told for the third time your order was next.If you read my other reviews, I am not hard to restaurants. I may be a bit witty about it, but I am rather forgiving. And slow food would not normally garner a 1-star review. But when staff member after staff member brushes you off, it gets to the point you start to wonder why anyone would put up with this crap. I imagine it has to be awesome food or the fact it has very nice prices. I will never know.On the way out, I visited the restroom. I am not sure the urinal ever flushed and two people who walked in after both commented on the horrible smell. I do hope the kitchen is more sanitary.BTW, I would have been much more lenient if one of the people that said they were checking on our order actually checked. Even if they came back and said, the kitchen forgot your order they are cooking it now. I worked in restaurants. I understand accidents happen. And I understand busy. I don't understand this level of apathy. I hope management reads this and alters things. If so, write a comment and we can try again someday and have a portion of actual food, and not just leave a restaurant review. Then again, maybe the prices have it where enough people are willing to suffer the abuse to keep you in business. If so ""God bless, this is America where you can run your business however you damn well please"". Peace guys! Unilt next time.",0,0,1,0,0

I've eaten here a handful of times before and will not be returning. We just wanted a cool place to sit, eat and watch the Grizzlies game. Since the only area with TV's was at the bar, we sat there. The man approached us and questioned why we decided to order waters to start out. When asking for a drink menu, the man came at my sister saying ""woah now, before we even think about drinking, can I see your ID?"" My sister shows the man her ID, and he proceeds to verbally tell her that he wasn't sure it was her, and hunts down the manager. Keep in mind my sister is 23 years old and doesn't look like a child in any sense. After the manager confirms that the ID is indeed my sister's, the bartender then continues the ordeal by asking to see her credit card with a name on it alongside the ID.

The fries were covered with the filling for the shepards pie, and that just tasted kind of off to me the meat did not taste good, and there was not a whole lot of cheese.

I am not sure what was in the batter, but it had an odd taste.

Lamb cutlets with mashed potatoes combined with cheese( wish I could remember the correct name). Smooth, well balanced flavors, lamb medium. 4 cutlets. Great meal $22 for starter and entree. Definitely recommend on ambiance, price and quality of food.",0,48,28,2,0

We sat at the table of our choosing and were promptly brought out drinks. We picked through the lunch menu, which prices are very reasonable on. I opted for the fish and chips after reading some reviews on Yelp, and the rest of the table got corned beef sandwiches and a salad and fries. Everything came out fairly quickly, and all at the same time. The fish was well breaded and had a nice crispness to the bite, although I did add a little salt but that's personal preference in the batter. The fries or chips are awesome, and I enjoyed them just as much as the fish honestly. My fiancée had the curry fries which looked awesome, I would like to try some of the other fries plates that they have as well. Everyone else enjoyed their food, my mother in law to be had to bring some of her food home. I would like to come back on a weekend night, it seems like a fun place!!",0,195,3,1,0

I tried to order online and it said that they weren't talking any more order. I call back and after a long and tedious conversation I was able to get my order placed. I wanted to do curbside but that is only an option if you place your order online. When I arrived there was an employee on the phone telling a customer that they couldn't hear them and that the person on the line's phone was the issue. They told them they had to order online. All of that was annoying but not too bad. I got the stuffed chicken breast and the Mac and cheese. Only one side of my chicken breast had stuffing in it. I would've tried to spread it around but I ate the side with the stuffing first. I also got the lobster Mac and cheese. It was watery. I followed the reheating steps but it didn't help. It was almost like someone poured water in the container and was very soupy. I had to throw most of it away as it was completely flavorless. It was $20......Update: the manager contacted me and rectified the situation. He was really understanding and was a great listener. I eat here a lot and this was my first issue do I won't let it keep me from going back. I think I'll stay away from the Mac and cheese but I'm still going for the chicken breast.,5,1306,448,2277,1

One of my parents favorite spots in Memphis for a special occasion. We have been to many steakhouses in the area, and this is by far always one of the best experiences with consistantly delicious food! We were lucky to have Jamison as our waiter this visit and had exceptional service. We started with the Calamari which is served with an asian chili sauce, it was perfectly crisp. We each ordered one of the prix fix options from the Holiday Classics Menu, which included a soup or salad, entree, side, and dessert! The portions are generous, and there will surely be leftovers. I ordered the potato leek soup with bacon dust, 11 oz filet with horseradish crust & béarnaise and creamed spinach.   The steak was so incredibly flavorful and tender! There was no steak left on my plate. My dad ordered the stuffed chicken, which may seem like a boring choice at a steakhouse, however it is a double chicken breast stuffed with garlic herb cheese and lemon butter, it comes out sizzling with crisp skin! We upgraded one of the sides to the sweet potato casserole with vanilla bean and a caramalized brown sugar topping. My mom ordered the filet with shrimp which was also a delicious choice! All of the entrees are unique and there is something for everyone! All of the options come with the bread pudding and ice cream, which was a hit for the whole table! We brought a bottle of wine, and then for dinner Jamison recommended a bottle of Duckhorn Merlot which accompanied our dinner beautifully. It was a wonderful meal, I highly recommend Ruth's Chris for your next dinner out! Ask to sit in Jamison's section for a superb dining experience!!",1,4961,1015,11969,1

Our server dismissed my husband's requests on how he wanted his food (with all his burger toppings on the side which shouldn't be a difficult task.) My filet was good so no complaints there.

The Dinner was $68 per person and everyone had to pay or pay and additional $40 for split plate charge ( which is outrageous I think) but let's talk about the food 1) we did crab cakes as an appetizer which was very cold , so we sent them back and they was much better the second time go round but still nothing great . 2) I ordered the filet for entree for $68 plus the additional $40 to share since I was only able to eat seafood but I was still charged for tasting my husband steak and it's was not even split or on a second plate when brought out to us  but the steak was just okay , I had better at Bone fish grill . And lastly 3)  was dessert which consisted of a strawberry crepe but was more like a soggy wet piece of bread with strawberries and whip cream . I'm sorry but the only thing good here was the cocktails. This place was over priced and had very limited menu options and no substitutions , not even a extra side to order. This was my first and final time here . I appreciate the hospitality but this was not worth a $590 check for 4 adults and 1 child which we was forced to pay $68 for his meal as well and he didn't even eat nor like the food ...

As we came in, the hostess told another couple they couldn't dine without a reservation so they left. However more than half the restaurant sat empty the entire time we were there. The popovers (my favorite bread since I was a kid) were crispy/hard over baked on the verge of burned. We asked for some not so over baked and were told they are all like that. The cheese soup was thin broth with clumps of oily cheese at the bottom. The main entree was good but the desert that we waited FOREVER for tasted like it sat out for ever. The bread pudding and brownie would have been so much better warmed but it looked and tasted like it was just slapped on a plate from the refrigerator. Our young server was nice but clearly didn't have much clue of what fine dining service should be. It was also very clear the tables next to us got more attention than we did.

I love coming to this establishment. It's a special place with an upscale feel and a southern charm. It's nestled in a corner of the quaint Harbor town community on Mud Island. It's got a beautiful view of the river as well. We came here for brunch and I had the Bel-Air salad which came with fresh California greens, sun-dried cherries, oranges, walnuts, walnut encrusted goat cheese, and orange-balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I added grilled salmon which made the whole thing wonderful!  You HAVE TO get the Kay-Pie for dessert.  You will be kicking yourself if you don't.  It's a scrumptious blend of coffee ice cream, praline candy pieces, whipped cream with a splash of Kahlua.  UNBELIEVABLE!!  It's one of the best desserts I've ever eaten in my life.Eric did a good job serving us and we look forward to returning.",0,12,241,370,1

Service was fine but a bit slow considering there were only two couples including us in the restaurant. Asada tacos were a solid choice but served with a lemon. I'm not sure why we got a lemon maybe it's a new thing or someone made a mistake. It's not a big deal but it takes you back to the inconsistency because the guacamole tasted like it had lemon instead of lime in it as well. Overall it is a decent meal at a fair price.

However, the next few times were REALLY bad, but then we had another great experience, and then recently a couple mediocre ones. So I've landed on the fact that they are ""just okay."" The staff changes frequently it seems, so maybe that plays a role. Some of my biggest gripes are that I went for happy hour and lunch one day with a friend, asked for the happy hour marg prices, and said, ""okay I'll get the lime margarita."" Then  after 2 of those and getting the bill, they charged twice the expected amount. She said to me- You didn't specify the happy hour margarita. ?? Then we have also tried their margarita flight, which was terrible and pure sugar. The thing I like most is their lunch chicken cheese and rice. Best thing on the menu. Also, I really hate how they advertise the ""best margarita in town."" It's not. Absolutely not.",2,253,168,172,1

It seemed that once the kitchen finally caught up, the host stand started turning people away, more than an hour before closing. We saw a number of parties come in but then immediately leave. Owner introduced himself to us and started to ask us how things were and then mid-sentence walked away (??) Food was ok. Not terrible but not much flavor either. They were out of quite a few things because ""we didn't expect to be busy."" The chorizo was a concerning grey-green color.

Our server was nice, but seemed flustered despite being one of three servers for the patio. The servers also seem confused by the table numbers- they tried on three different occasions to deliver food to us that wasn't ours. We had a big variety- standouts being the breakfast tacos and pancakes- all hot. Honestly surprised because it took 45 minutes for it to arrive. We'd been sitting, obviously done, for over 20 minutes before our server asked if we were ready for the check. This allowed us to see a table of 11 be seated (health department directive is groups of 8 or less, but maybe outdoors is okay?), their waiter go over everything that wasn't available for lunch which had to be a longer list than what was available, and see another waiter drop a spoon off by the bowl instead of the handle. Gross. I'm completely sympathetic to how difficult it must be opening a restaurant, let alone in a pandemic. It's why we didn't try this place sooner. They've been open over 2 months and if anything, restaurant restrictions have been loosened, so at some point, you have to wonder if it's lack of leadership. While we did visit mid-morning, there were empty tables inside and outside, wait times were far too long, and it seems crazy you'd run out of the majority of lunch items before the lunch hour even started. If I want to wait two hours for a pretty pricey breakfast, I'll save it for a nice brunch.",0,0,225,42,0

Maybe even some beer run girls (or guys) outside for people wanting to grab a quick easy beer. The food was great and it came out in an average time so no problems there.

It's an outside/inside venue - complete with a waterway running though the eating area. This place exudes atmosphere almost as much as the good food. Since his wife had the party catered by them, there were a number of good dishes to choose from - scratch made guacamole (yum!), tender, delicious juicy brisket (double yum!), and some small potatos that were toasted nicely, as well as some grilled veggies that were quite good.Finally, they had a ""new way of fixing corn on the cob"" that I had not seen or tasted before. They were half-ear cobs that appeared to be coated in - ""something good"" - then placed in a dish and cooked in the oven. Oh, in addition to the ""something good"", they added more toppings, like cheese and parsley (I think, I wish I had asked someone). The cobs were then finished in the oven and came out toasty and juicy. Yes, they were quite good, even if I didn't describe them so well. Anyway - you need to try them when you go.The servers were rather pleasant, but mostly the food was set out and self-serve.

Kids were able to run around freely. Yard games. Parking is easy. Food that was good: sausage and cheese plate, chicken tenders and fries, wings. Great service from the woman who took our order for 11 people. Food came out decently fast.Cons: the first bartender we encountered was a jerk. There is one bar that isn't full service but has the full menu for the other bar at it and the bartender was a jerk when we tried ordering from the menu. The service was super slow at the other main bar. While the adult food came out fast, the kids' food didn't come out until the adults were done eating and we had to tell two different people we were missing their food. Street corn was okay but they used sour cream and too much lime on it. The brisket was pretty disappointing especially being in Memphis. And finally why I took the time to write this review and attach a photo was the skimping of my $12 brisket tacos. I would rather they charge more to put a normal adult amount size of meat on these because the sauce and pickled onions tasted great. The brisket plate was $18 and that had many slices of full size brisket on it (not that the brisket is any good but still). We would go again but don't go for a main meal...maybe just a pre dinner snack.",1,191,9,13,0

The interior, while the furniture was laid out like a Shoney's, is really cool and modern with cool wood paneling and several big screen TVs. I swear there must have been a convention because the place was packed even after 1 when we arrived for a late lunch.The salsa was good and fresh which in my opinion helps make or break an experience at a Mexican restaurant. We started with some queso blanco (white cheese dip) which was also very good. My friends had been here before and ordered various items from tacos to fajitas which they said were good. I ordered the Cocina Especial which was incredible! A healthy portion of grilled steak, chicken, and shrimp with sautéed onions and bell peppers on a bed of Mexican rice with a thin layer of the white cheese dip on top. It was amazing.

The Lentil Soup - although, served in a bag (which was different) - I was able to bring it back to work and heat it up. I can see why some people would think that would be inconvenient, but, really, it is quite convenient, especially if you don't want to eat it right away. The Lentil Soup is probably the BEST SOUP, vegan or not, that I have had. The flavor, the vegetables, the broth - AMAZING. I will order this again. I also tried the Taco Salad - This was also delicious. The ""walnut meat"" is crushed walnuts seasoned with spices. I am a huge fan. I will order that again.I sampled a hand-full of juices, but I settled on the Antioxidant Bliss - extremely refreshing. I will 100% order that again. I can't commend the women working the truck enough. She let me sample all the juices I wanted, until I settled on the right one. RAW GIRLS - thank you for being in Memphis!! I am excited to explore your menu more!",0,227,45,0,0

Really. Their juices and food menu items are great. I absolutely love their tuscan white bean soup. The mung bean noodle salad is one of a kind and SO delicious. All the juices are unique with so many fresh and good-for-you ingredients that you wouldn't be able to find at any other juice place. Their menu changes weekly and they post it on their instagram and facebook so everyone can keep up! One good thing about this is that you know every menu item is made with the freshest ingredients and they will not compromise for quality. However, if you do really love something but it doesn't come back on the menu, you're outta luck. Sometimes they run out of juices quickly, but that probably just speaks to how popular that menu item is! They also offer some good deals occasionally when they need to clean out their inventory (buy one get ones, buy 3 get one free, etc.). Love that they also have two locations on Poplar in East Memphis and one on Cooper in Midtown - makes it very convenient to get your health food fix when you need it! Raw Girls does something unique in Memphis and that is something I really like about them.Here is where I really understand why customer service in any type of business is so important. I went on their instagram page and made a comment about their non fruit/veg juices all having sea salt in them and whether they would consider making any of them without sea salt in the future. I meant absolutely no harm, but the (one-sided) interaction ended up with me being blocked from viewing their instgram profile. I got no explanation or response to my comments which was quite confusing. I've posted a screenshot showing my second comment after being confused as to why my first comment was deleted. If you view their instagram page now, that 2nd comment is also deleted. I'm a bit confused as to why I would be blocked since I can easily view their content by opening up their profile in a browser without being logged in (or even logged in under a different account). Anyway, this whole situation was quite strange to me and made me question how they treat customers through social media, their honesty and transparency, and why any business would resort to passive aggressive means so that they can protect themselves(?).A few other things to note - every 16 ounce juice is $9. Quite pricey, since most juice places I know charge, on average, less than $9. And $8 for chia seed pudding which seems a tad much for a simple preparation. I ended up bringing mine home and adding a bunch more fruit into it since there were only a few slices of banana, a few blackberries, and some pomegranate seeds. There is also sea salt in this chia seed parfait.... if you do like your pudding on the salty side, you'll like this one! Finally, just a note - I've also seen prices for the same menu item increase from previous weeks.Will I be back to purchase some juices? Maybe. But I'll most likely end up thinking about whether I want to deal with a business that seem like they pick and choose their customers.minus 1 star for customer serviceminus 1 star for the priceminus 1 star for lack of consistency",3,181,335,296,1

My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary this past weekend. As we are in the midst of a pandemic, we didn't desire to eat in the restaurant. We were excited to learn that Texas de Brazil was doing takeout. We placed an order, and when we arrived to pick it up, the hostesses told us to wait by the bar for the bartender to get our order. After about 10 minutes of awkwardly standing by the bar with no bartender in sight, one of the servers came over to help. She grabbed our bag of food and went over the order. 2 entrees with 2 sides each, rolls, and 2 salads. There were 6 containers in the bag plus rolls, so I assumed it was 1 container with entree plus 2 containers with sides for each of us. We appeared to be missing the salads, so a hostess went and got salads from the kitchen. When we got back to our hotel, we found that we were also missing 2 sides, so for one of the meals (for which we paid $19), all we got was a half pound of meat. I wish I had checked the containers more thoroughly. However, for a $50 meal from an establishment such as this, I would have expected them to be accurate. We suspect that server forgot to give us one of the bags, but I don't fault her because she was trying to fill in since the bartender wasn't around. Also, they could not give us eating utensils. They said because of the pandemic restrictions. However, their dine-in patrons could have silverware, so I don't get it. Luckily, the hotel bar lent us some.

At all. I sent it back and was told I was the first person in the history of the restaurant to send it back (playfully). It tasted like watered down Kraft. Not sure what chef did wrong, but it was terrible.In lieu of the Mac, the Manager recommended the Brussels sprouts. Omg! Heavenly. Divine. All that is right in the world with an element of ""of course it's healthy, right?""Mashed potatoes: Good, but nothing I'd return for.The wine list is extensive (although we'd hoped for flights of wine), and the spreads for the bread are delicious... The ambiance lacked a little something I couldn't quite put my finger on (this could have been the sheer openness of the restaurant, though). Service was outstanding from the hostess to the server, manager and even bus boy. Valet was kind enough to help my husband surprise me by delivering a beautiful gift to the waiter to bring to me after dinner, and the waiter brought us complimentary homemade truffles to take home with us (mmmm!). Valet had our vehicle pulled around before we even got there, which I love.All in all, it was a wonderful dining experience.

The manager came over and tried to make things better but the meal was a total disaster. He even offered dessert. I got the chocolate lava cake. IT WAS NOT COOKED PROPERLY EITHER. I understand the cake is not fully cooked so as to have a molten center but this one was not cooked as it should have been. I would have given one star because our over priced meal was a total fail.

Michael, my server was great and funny. He was especially in a pepped up mood because his favorite NFL team won. For some reason I believe we still would have received exceptional service with or without the win. After we finished our wonderful meal we walked outside to retrieve my car from the CONTRACTED valet service and unfortunately my car had been stolen. Thankfully Fleming's has a security camera system that captured the entire ordeal. The selfish action of some sloppy criminals led to me experiencing how professional and kind the Fleming's staff can be. Mr. Paul and other employees made many complimentary offers to us but I was a little flustered and not able to take advantage. But the final offer is what shocked me and I had to accept. One of the hostesses (I won't share her name in order to respect her privacy) offered to take us home at the end of her shift; which ended about five minutes after she made the offer. This gesture was especially kind to me because she took on a responsibility that was all the way outside of her professional duties. To me THAT is what Memphis is about. Helping, being kind, and going beyond. Things happen and they happen everywhere (so don't talk crap about my city).

So if the food's good enough for the big boys, then it's good enough for everyone.I chose a two-item BBQ platter and it was a heap of food. The pork ribs, for example, came easily off their bones and were doused in just the right amount of sauce: not too much, but not too little. So much meat, in fact, that I boxed up most of my pulled pork to go. Fortunately, it lasted in the fridge into the next morning, exactly as it's supposed to do, and it retained all of its deliciously smoky flavor.

Due to Covid, I was unsure what the dining rules with a party of 6 would be. I called the restaurant about a month in advance to make reservations and was told that the max of people per table were four people. Not a problem, our party of 6 decided to split our party into two's. Three people per table.Upon arriving, two members of our party were arriving about 5 minutes later, and I asked the hostess, could the parties that were there be seated. We were told again that the max per table was four people and since we booked two reservations that all parties had to be there due to the 90-minute time limit for dining. Cool beans- we decided to wait until everyone arrived, which was 5 minutes later. About 15 minutes of being seated, we noticed that several tables had six people per table!  Not just one, SEVERAL! To confirm, I asked our waiter what was the max of seating , and sure enough, I was told four! We didn't want our night to be ruined so we decided to finish the night despite how we felt. Our waiter was nice and kind so that was a wonderful experience.I would think that during a time like this, this establishment would strive to be fair and just.

We all agreed that the variety of desserts were very rich, sweet & delicious! I had a second piece of trout and requested a to go bag.

We all enjoy the Pesto Chicken and Fresh Mozzarella Flatbread. A nice, tasty start to our meal.If you enjoy tender, flavorful Salmon, then you need to treat yourself to the Salmon. Of course, all of the other dishes are equally good. This time, however, all 3 of us decided to go with the Salmon. Everyone enjoyed their meal. One item of note on the Green Beans. They normal serve the Green Beans a bit crunchy. If you're like me, you can ask them to cook them a bit longer and still enjoy them.Almost forgot to mention, they have a nice selection of classy adult beverages; I even tried the Peach Riesling Mule this time which I rather enjoyed. Since tastes vary, check out the selections yourself and, maybe, try something different - you might like it.Of course, after the dinner comes dessert right? Well, this was no exception. And, being the Birthday Boy, they treated me to a Peanut Butter Torte Mini Indulgence (you can have your choice). The chocolate was smooth and the serving size was just right, after a big dinner.Continuing in the tradition of ""exceeding expectations"", after dinner the Manager came to check on our meal, and he was kind enough to present me with yet another Complimentary Flatbread for our next visit.

They have so many good choices for food and the service has always been good. This time I opted for the Pot-Roasted Basil-Ricotta Chicken, quite enjoyable. The chicken was tender and well-seasoned. It was served with the Basil-Ricotta sauce to enhance the flavor, which it did nicely. In past visits, the green beans appeared to have been blanched and were crunchy. When I asked, they did a great job of cooking them longer; the green beans were tender and tasted just as good, only not so crunchy. They even allowed me to swap the roasted tomato pilaf for their delicious mashed potatoes. My wife enjoyed her Cedar Plank Roasted Salmon as well. Her green beans also were tender. Simply ask them to cook them longer if you do not care for crunchy green beans.Ever notice that some of the nicer restaurants understand that when you eat a big meal, you don't ""need"" a big dessert - you don't have room for it. Well, Seasons 52 is one of those restaurants. They have ""Mini Indulgences"". A smaller version of a delicious dessert, but not enough to make you feel stuffed after your meal. They also charge a smaller amount, nice. Well, I decided to go with my favorite - the Mocha Macchiato - incredible, and just the right serving size. My wife enjoyed her Pecan Pie almost as much I enjoyed my dessert. You may know, but they have a rotating Food Menu based on the Four Seasons of the year. They also have a rotating menu of seasonal drinks. These allow you to have a wide variety of food over the course of the year.Whatever time of year you go, you will have a tremendous selection of incredible food from which to choose.

I had first experienced Seasons 52 this past January during a Yelp Elite Event. During that visit, we were treated to a large sampling of their menu of appetizers, entrees, desserts and signature cocktails. The food was high quality and of excellent taste all provided by their quality Wait Staff; the Head Chef also addressed our group. Recently I was able to take my wife to enjoy the food as well. We started with some very good cocktails that helped us enjoy the wonderful Meatball appetizer (one which I had enjoyed during my first visit). My wife truly enjoyed her Salmon while I enjoyed my Boneless Short Ribs. The Salmon was delicious and my meat was so tender it fell apart as it melted in my mouth. We each rounded out our meal with a Mocha Machiato Mini-Indulgence. As with the rest of our meal, the taste and texture of the dessert was fantastic. Now I realize we may not be able to afford to go every week, but on special occassions it is worth the investment. However, we did learn that they have Happy Hour Deals - an order of Flat Bread (delicious), with a Flight of three 2-ounce glasses of wine plus a full 6-ounce glass of wine - all for only $15. Plus they have a selection of Small Plates for only $5 - including the Meatballs. If you haven't already, you may want to put Seasons 52 on your list - during all Seasons of the year.",0,28,230,119,1

As for my boyfriend's meal, he told me it was the *worst* boil he's ever had, and he's the kind of guy who eats seafood boils at buffets from time to time. The crab was dry and the boil seemed to be lacking in butter to make up for it. He also said the meal was overall pretty tasteless, which was disappointing since it looked so good.

All of the food came out at once and was luke warm, at best. We ordered each boil with  different sauces but they all tasted the same. We had to ask for dipping sauce, remoulade nor garlic butter were an option. Calamari was good, as most the other food. We Had never heard of green mussels, so we had to order. They were pretty good but...super fishy taste and they came out on the half shell, so we couldn't tell if the shell had opened themselves or forced open.

If you need crab crackers they are three dollars if you do not return them  Then finally after 16 min of being in the restaurant a waitress finally came over, to take our drink order.  We were ready to order at that point so we did. I would of left by now if my nephew and his wife did not want seafood so bad. The tipping point was when the waitress told me she needed two form of identification to hold while we ate.  I told her I was not giving her my ID's to send her manager over if she needed to.  When the manager finally came over I told her I was not giving them my ID's. She told me I had to.  I spent 26 years in the military and I retired.  She was not getting my ID's. I told her I would pay for the meal up front but she was not getting my ID. She told me I had to or I could leave.  We left! She was rude and in my opinion not very friendly towards any customer.  I will never go back and eat at that Red Hook.  I do not see them staying in business very long especially if they keep the manger that was there on Saturday 14 March around 330.  By far a terrible place to g .  I hope this review can save someone some time.  Because that is 35 minutes of my life I will never get back.  Terrible customer service, rude management and overall just pathetic.  I hope this helps.

Looking for a upscale steakhouse. The services was good but my steak was very tough. I ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare. It was seasoned well but from the first cut from the steak knife it was like cutting into a piece of leather.  My guest ordered the ribeye without the bone. His was tender and easy too cut. I even gave him a piece of my steak. He could hardly chew it. I even asked the waitress to get me another knife. I ended up using my pocket knife to cut my steak. The table service came by and I told them my steak was tough. I finally finished the tough steak was not going to waste $55.00. One of the kitchen managers cleared our table. I told him that my steak was tough. He acted surprised and asked why I did not mentioned to our waitress. I told him that I did. He then wanted to give me a free dessert.

Decided to go in - first customers of day. When waiter finally got here, we ordered drinks and then both ordered petite filets (we are small people w/small capacity for beef, not cheap). My husband's was fine but I first noticed mine was smaller than his. It also appeared to have an unusual texture just sitting on plate. Both unusual because I eat medium rare, hubby eats medium well, so more rare steak of same size is always a bit fatter; prime aged beef doesn't have a nubby outside texture and a flat middle like a fallen cake.I was getting ""no no"" feelings, but so hard to get service and I was hungry, decided to give it a try, I literally had to saw my way through what was, according to menu, ""Prime Aged Beef."" Prime filet cuts like butter. Obviously, this meat was neither prime nor a filet mignon.I took a small bite, it was tough as leather, although it was med. rare. I sawed a good sized chunk and gave my husband a try. He immediately spit out a big piece of grizzle and was upset - his steak was fine, what was going on?When the server finally got back to us (we were the only customers, mind you, hubby was drinking a cocktail and server never checked on us even for a cocktail refill), I told him I couldn't eat it, hadn't touched the side and gave it back to him. At which point a large, ill-kempt man carried it back to me, stood right on top of me aggressively, threw the plate down in front of me and told me I was crazy if I thought I wasn't going to pay for the meal, treating us like the scammer he was. He declared the steak ""more than half eaten,"" at which point I picked the grizzle chunk off my husband's plate w/a fork and basically told the manager to eat it if he thought it was so great, that I could not. We were dressed casually, but Memphis is a tourist city and on weekend afternoons, everyone's casual no matter where they're from. We were still better dressed and cleaner looking than the store manager.I have never been had a high end restaurant manager (if, indeed he was the manager - service staff was formal, he was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and chinos, as I said, looked unkempt, hair a mess, clothes looked slept in, etc.) so aggressively try to physically (or emotionally) intimidate me. In fact, no one's even treated me like that in cheap places.We said we'd pay for my husband's meal and cocktail, but no way were we paying for the steak, which he was still insisting I ""ate most of"" even as I kept holding up the grizzle which was 1/3 the size of what was clearly NOT ""Prime Aged Anything,"" let alone a prime aged filet mignon. He tried to force us pay for the half I ""ate."" We told him he was rude, insulting, we'd never be back and would not pay for anything but my husband's meal and drinks.I asked for his card, the name and number of his manager, which he gave me, actually daring me to call because ""he's never there and you'll never get him,"" and pretty much throwing his card at us.After going through all the online reviews later, it seems this place is either good, or people get treated like we were. I have not called Jim LoSapio at River City Management Group (the Chop House manager's name was Brad Strong) who the manager said I'd never get to talk to, yet. I do have six pages of cut/paste reviews all saying the management didn't care and would not respond. On top of the manager's ""go ahead and see if anyone cares"" attitude, I let it sit.Not a good thing - it was three weeks ago and we're still fuming. So I guess I'll have to start writing TRUE reviews and give him a call. Failing that, my business is social media for large corporations, so I'll just call myself the client and treat them with all the ""respect"" they didn't give us.It was one of the most insulting evening ""meals"" I've never eaten. Read the other reviews, check Travel Advisor, etc., and you'll see the same pattern I did - either the food was good or food and management horrid.We still left the non-existent server a good tip - probably more than we should because he never even once refilled our water, let alone questioned if we were happy with the food and would my husband like another cocktail (where we all know is where restaurants make their $). Just didn't blame him for Brad Strong's aggressive, insulting remarks and attempts at physical intimidation.Take your chances. I certainly will never go in any of the River City Management Group's properties again, although we have enjoyed one or two of their other venues on Beale for musictripadvisor.com/ShowUser…",0,0,28,0,0

BUT THE FOOD WAS SO GOOD I DO NOT CARE.We arrived around 9:30am for breakfast on Saturday. According to Yelp, they open at 9:00am. BUT they didn't really seem like they were open? It took a while to get menus and then it took a REALLY long time to get our coffees and food (at least 40 minutes? and the coffee came last, weirdly). A few minutes before we left, a woman showed up who seemed to be very service-oriented. It made me think that the gentleman taking care of us until she got there might be more kitchen staff not used to service? Service was definitely not strong. BUT THE FOOD. I love Middle Eastern food. And I LOVE Middle Eastern food for breakfast. But it's a bit harder to find a Middle Eastern restaurant that serves breakfast? If you are reading this review, the most important thing to take from it? QUEEN OF SHEBA SERVES BREAKFAST, Y'ALL. For the four of us, we ordered Egg with Foul (mashed fava beans with garlic, tomatoes, onion, and spices), falafel (2 orders, since it was 4 pieces/order), eggs with fassolia (white beans with garlic, tomatoes, onion, and spices), and hummus. The fresh bread was FANTASTIC. The foul and fassolia were amazing, and I would eat them at least monthly (weekly?) if I lived in Memphis? THIS IS WHAT I WANT FOR BREAKFAST. The falafel wasn't my favorite falafel ever, but it was good. And the hummus was very good as well. I really enjoyed every bite of food we ate at Queen of Sheba, which is good, because we waited A WHILE for it. The restaurant is definitely a bit of a dive with some mixed up decor and wall materials. And we were the only table eating breakfast (I think there were a few to go orders). But who cares?

Aside from the place being old and outdated, the dining room is just nasty. At least it was to me. They are gradually using the do it yourself method of updating the space, and you can decide for yourself if you like what they're doing. What they don't seem to be doing is much cleaning. First of all the entire tiled floor is slippery like they've used soap once upon a time but never mopped it up. The floor looks very dirty to me, but looks like it wouldn't be too hard to clean either. Their solution seems to be doormats. Let's cover the entire floor with doormats and we'll never have to mop it. I counted 11 doormats throughout the dining room. How bizarre. They have a guy walking around on the booths taping the wall with painter's tape while I'm eating there. I'm not sure if they have a back door, but there was a delivery guy unloading a truck bringing a shipment in through the dining room. He is using a Walgreens shopping cart to bring the order in. If there were a Walgreens in the parking lot, I would assume he borrowed it. Since the closest Walgreens happens to be west of Stratford, on the south side of Summer, I think a reasonable person would believe it was stolen. The worst of it is, and what really grossed me out the most is that my bread had been served on a plate that reminds me of a straw hat an Asian lady would wear out on the farm. Or perhaps a wicker basket to throw trash in. Either way, it's easy to find this sort of stuff at the thrift store or a yard sale. Once it occurred to me how difficult it would be to clean, I took a closer look. It was so nasty, I'd rather have eaten bread that had been thrown on the floor. IF YOU SERVE FOOD TO YOUR CUSTOMERS IN SOMETHING, IT MUST GO THROUGH THE DISHWASHER EACH AND EVERY TIME! Fxxkxxx sick! When I paid, I was able to get a look into the kitchen. I'll just leave it there. I do not have anything against these guys. They're good people and I'm sure they're struggling to feed themselves just like everyone else. My pictures show what my eyes saw and I cannot recommend this place to anyone. As soon as I sat down I ordered sweet tea. I did not say the word ""ice"" and they brought me some hot tea. I'm not really a hot tea drinker. Turns out they don't have iced tea. Turns out this hot tea was good and I loved it. I asked for a coke. He brought me a can, which is fine with me, just letting you know, no soda fountain, no iced tea. I'm not sure if they have ice. Just as well. Ice machines are very hard to clean. It was a teenage boy serving me. He was 15 or 16. He was very friendly and spoke English very well. I'm sure he could have helped me decide what to choose, but I'd already done my homework and immediately ordered Lamb Ghallaba. A few minutes later, I got a salad that I didn't know I was getting. It wasn't a typical salad, it had loads of tomatoes and a few cucumber. The problem with commercially farmed tomatoes, is that they're willing to sacrifice flavor for appearance and resistance to bruising. That's why people grow their own. These particular tomatoes had no flavor whatsoever. The cucumber was only slightly better. The Lamb Ghallaba and the bread were actually quite good. The bread was sort of a Naan. The dish was sort of a curry pan fried with meat and veggies. The cooked tomatoes were no better than the raw ones, but I could taste the bell peppers. He didn't ask if I wanted it spicy and I didn't think to ask. Therefore, it was very mild. For the most part, the food tasted good, but I don't want to think of the conditions it was prepared in. I was happy about the price I paid for my food. It was like $13.07 after tax. Problem is, the teenager gave me a $5 and a $1 so I gave him the $5. Before I'd gotten out the door, I realized he didn't offer me the $.93. Yes, I did turn around and demand another dollar, which he gladly did. They'll never get another dollar from me. Two stars is the best I can do guys.",12,236,636,4487,1

Let me warn you; prepare for a feast because the entrée comes with a bowl of maraq (lamb broth with hints of cinnamon and coriander served with lemon to enhance flavors), hummus and tanou (huge piece of fresh nan-like bread)!

The service were very helpful and they explained all of our questions about the dishes which was nice since we had a lot. The bread is made in-house and comes right out of the oven and it's soooo good! They also make an amazing garlic butter that you can spread on the bread (just ask for it if you want to try something different). The minute we sat down they gave us a free salad as an appetizer. If you want to try the lamb soup they can give you a complimentary little bowl to try it out. I don't eat meat but my mom and grandmother both enjoyed it!So whenever I come here we always get the hummus, it's super smooth and has a lot of flavor (and it goes really well with the bread!). The baba ganoush, which has a delicate flavor and we also get the foul which is a dish made with fava beans and has a lot of nice spices, if you don't like eggs you can get it without and if you do it's pretty good too!

Queen of Sheba is as unconventional an experience as you will find in this city. My brother and I went at an unusual time during the weekday (about 3pm) and stepped into a different world. The dining room was sparsely populated but by no means desolate, as the lively buzz of foreign conversation wafted and hung in the air as comforting, as alien, as welcome as the aromas drifting in from the kitchen. For a moment, I forgot where I was.The atmosphere here is not dictated by the seating, by the decor, or even by the Arabic writings that adorn the walls. Atmosphere here is instead a product of the people who walk through the door. A thousand different shades of people, sporting a thousand different styles of clothing, wielding with their tongues yet another thousand dialects, harmonious and united in the simple and unmolested glory of the food brought to the table.My brother and I shared two plates of hummous, one with chicken and one without. I continue to be pleased in my discovery that every Arab restaurant I go to has their own distinct hummous. This place has some of the best.Next, we moved on to two bowls of Lamb Fhasa, a violently simmering bowl of meat and other flavorful components, served piping hot in a clay dish.

The food is pretty good I will admit most days. However, the customer service is horrible. They only have one cashier and she moves slow as molasses. She takes order, money, drinks, gives orders, phone orders, etc. due to this it gets very chaotic and unorganized. They have a very unstructured way of getting their orders out. They have a standard size table and a person from the back stacks the orders on a table. It's so unorganized and it causes a delay in people getting their food. Why why why is their one register and one cashier. On to the food, I usually get greens, yams, and fish. The fish is pretty good, but the yams are very firm and undercooked. The greens could use more seasoning and less stems. I will not be spending my money her any longer due to the poor customer service. Then, the cashier gave me one hot sauce pack, one napkin, and one tarter sauce cup. I paid $11.00 for a plate and you give me one hot sauce packet. NO. HONEY.

WARNING: DO NOT ask Peggy if the angels are for sale. :-DI ordered Tuesday's special, the fried chicken (white meat) with two sides (creamy potatoes and greens).I'm not sure how one can make fried chicken healthy, but it sure was scrumptious.  Golden, crispy and perfectly salted. The mashed potatoes had bits of skin in it, which I like, and I got the feeling it didn't have sour cream or a bunch of other ingredients mixed into it. The collard greens were also perfectly flavored, but not necessarily chopped into bite sizes. The sweet tea was not too sweet. I usually order half sweet, half unsweetened.  This was perfect for my taste buds. My to-go order came out in less than 10 minutes and Peggy was sweet as pie.
